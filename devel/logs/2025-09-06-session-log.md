# Session Log: 2025-09-06

## Previous Session Summary (2025-09-05)

**Where we left off:**
- **9:00 AM - 6:40 PM**: Successfully resolved site-wide centering issue
  - Root cause: Overly broad CSS rule `p,div,span{max-width:75ch}` constraining all divs
  - Fixed with more specific CSS targeting only text content
  - Commits: `6298b4a` (centering fix) and `fc1dfcb` (visual hierarchy improvements)

- **6:05 PM - 8:59 PM**: Completed SITE-008 issue verification and closure
  - ConvertKit email infrastructure confirmed fully implemented
  - All acceptance criteria met (GDPR compliance, static export compatibility, analytics)
  - Issue closed as completed

- **Final Investigation**: Discovered that original alignment issue analysis was complex
  - Initial theory about missing `site-container` class was incorrect - class exists
  - Screenshot analysis showed container-level centering issue vs logo alignment
  - Multiple theories explored but ultimate resolution achieved through CSS specificity fix

**Current Status**: Site properly centered and functioning ‚úÖ
