# Development Session Log - 2025-08-22-00

## Session Start
- **Time**: 2025-08-22 07:25 AM
- **Task**: Investigate and fix Next.js build caching for GitHub Pages deployment
- **Issue**: "No Cache Detected" warning during Pages build process

## Issue Details
- **Problem**: GitHub Pages build showing cache warning, resulting in slower builds
- **Impact**: Slower CI builds, not leveraging Next.js persistent caching
- **Documentation**: https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/ci-build-caching
- **Solution Needed**: Configure GitHub Actions to persist `.next/cache` between builds

## Current Status
- Site successfully deployed with new content and branding
- Build functional but not optimized for CI caching
- Need to investigate current GitHub Actions workflow configuration

## Progress Log
- ✅ **Investigated workflow**: Found existing `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` 
- ✅ **Identified issue**: Workflow had npm caching but missing Next.js build cache
- ✅ **Added Next.js caching**: Configured `actions/cache@v4` for `.next/cache` directory
- ✅ **Cache strategy**: Key based on package-lock.json + source files, with fallback restore keys

## Configuration Added
```yaml
- name: Cache Next.js build
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.npm
      ${{ github.workspace }}/.next/cache
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}-${{ hashFiles('**/*.js', '**/*.jsx', '**/*.ts', '**/*.tsx') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}-
```

## Expected Benefits
- **Faster CI builds** by reusing Next.js cache between builds
- **Reduced build times** especially for unchanged source files
- **More efficient GitHub Actions usage** (lower CI costs)
- **Elimination of "No Cache Detected" warning**

## 404 Issue Resolution
- ✅ **Root cause**: Custom domain configuration disconnected in GitHub Pages settings
- ✅ **Resolution**: User re-added pipermorgan.ai domain in Pages settings
- ✅ **Site status**: Now working correctly at pipermorgan.ai

## Workflow Architecture Review
- ✅ **Confirmed proper setup**: Sequential (not parallel) workflow architecture
- ✅ **Custom workflow**: Builds Next.js and pushes to gh-pages branch
- ✅ **Auto workflow**: GitHub deploys static files from gh-pages to Pages hosting
- ✅ **No cleanup needed**: Standard two-stage deployment pipeline working correctly

## Session Summary
- Fixed Next.js build caching for faster CI builds
- Resolved 404 issue (DNS/domain configuration)
- Confirmed optimal GitHub Pages deployment architecture
- All systems operational and properly configured
