# Session Log - 2025-09-11

## Context: Previous Session Recap

### Previous Issue: Layout Regression - Content Left Alignment (RESOLVED ✅)
**Status**: Completely resolved on 2025-09-10

**What was Fixed**:
- Layout regression where site content was left-aligned instead of centered
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent container class usage between components
  - Some components used proper `site-container` class (defined in CSS)
  - Other components used undefined `container` class, causing left-alignment
- **Fix Applied**: Updated 10+ files to consistently use `site-container` class
  - Fixed 29+ instances of `'container mx-auto px-4'` → `'site-container'`
  - All components now use properly defined CSS class

**Current State**: Site layout is working correctly with consistent centering
