## 7:15 AM - Finalizing Key Decisions

### **Open Questions Posed**
Presented user with critical decisions needed before Phase 4 implementation:

#### **1. Image Naming Convention**
**Question**: Should robo* images have canonical names?

**User Decision**: âœ… Standardize on `robot-[WORD].webp` format
- Examples: `robot-trainer.webp`, `robot-limb.webp`, `robot-ethics.webp`
- User will follow this format going forward
- Legacy images can be aligned later (optional)

#### **2. Slug Generation Rules**
**Questions**:
- Use full title or text before colon?
- Max slug length?
- How to handle collisions?

**User Decisions**: âœ…
- **Stop at colon**: Use only text before `:` character
- **Word limit**: 6 words maximum (suggested and accepted)
- **Collision handling**: Add next word from title, then append `-2`, `-3` if needed

**Examples**:
- "Systemic Kindness: Building Methodology..." â†’ `systemic-kindness`
- "Building Piper Morgan: Methodology..." â†’ `building-piper-morgan`
- "The Weekend Sprint Chronicles: How We Built..." â†’ `weekend-sprint-chronicles`

#### **3. CSV Configuration**
**Questions**:
- Where should CSV live?
- Git-tracked or external?

**User Decisions**: âœ…
- **Location**: `/data/blog-metadata.csv`
- **Git Strategy**: Checked into repository
- **Rationale**: Version history, easy rollback, transparent changes
- **Future Enhancement**: Web UI for management (nice-to-have, not urgent)

**CSV Schema** (10 columns):
1. `slug` - Human-readable URL identifier (unique)
2. `hashId` - Original Medium post ID (12-char hex)
3. `title` - Full article title
4. `imageSlug` - Image filename (robot-[word].webp)
5. `workDate` - When work was actually done (ISO 8601)
6. `pubDate` - When published on Medium (ISO 8601)
7. `category` - "Narrative" or "Insight" (enum)
8. `cluster` - Narrative chapter name (optional)
9. `featured` - Boolean (only ONE true at a time)
10. `notes` - Internal notes (optional)

#### **4. Featured Article Selection**
**Question**: Selection method?
- A: Always most recent
- B: Manual selection (CSV flag)
- C: Hybrid (manual override + fallback)

**User Decision**: âœ… Hybrid approach
- Primary: Use post where `featured = true` in CSV
- Fallback: If none selected, use most recent by pubDate
- Goal: Add flair to homepage and promote article series

### **Action Taken**
Created comprehensive decision document: `/docs/blog-slug-and-csv-decisions.md`

**Document Contents**:
- Image naming standards
- Slug generation algorithm (with pseudo-code)
- CSV schema and validation rules
- Featured article logic
- Implementation priorities
- Open tasks for user (classify posts, determine work dates, etc.)

## 7:25 AM - Dev Server Cleanup

### **Issue Reported**
User shared screenshot showing multiple background dev servers:
- `npm run dev` running and killed
- Multiple accumulated sessions

### **Investigation**
Checked background shells:
- Shell `ded600`: Killed (was on port 3001)
- Shell `5a7b5f`: Running on port 3003
- Process `91775`: next-server on port 3000

**Errors Observed**:
- Port conflicts (3000 in use, falling back to 3001, 3003)
- ENOENT errors for build manifests
- Favicon conflicts
- Header warnings (expected for static export)

### **Resolution**
1. Killed shell `5a7b5f` (port 3003)
2. Killed process `91775` (port 3000)
3. Started fresh dev server on port 3000
4. Confirmed clean startup: âœ… http://localhost:3000

**Note**: The "headers will not automatically work with output: export" warning is expected and safe - headers are configured at GitHub Pages level.

## Current Status: 7:30 AM

### âœ… **Completed Today**
1. **Roadmap Synthesis** - Integrated user priorities with technical recommendations
2. **Decision Finalization** - All key decisions made for Phases 4-5
3. **Documentation** - Created 3 comprehensive documents:
   - `docs/blog-platform-roadmap.md` (full roadmap)
   - `docs/blog-roadmap-summary.md` (quick reference)
   - `docs/blog-slug-and-csv-decisions.md` (implementation standards)
4. **Dev Environment** - Cleaned up and restarted dev server

### ðŸŽ¯ **Ready for Phase 4 Implementation**

**Phase 4: Human-Legible Slugs** (3-4 hours estimated)

**Tasks**:
1. Implement slug generation algorithm
2. Generate slugs for all 155 existing posts
3. Add slug field to medium-posts.json
4. Update routing from [postId] to [slug]
5. Add redirects for old hash URLs
6. Test all 155 posts accessible
7. Deploy to production

**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

**Decisions Finalized**:
- âœ… Slug format: text-before-colon, 6-word max
- âœ… Collision handling: add next word, then numbers
- âœ… Image format: robot-[word].webp
- âœ… CSV location: /data/blog-metadata.csv
- âœ… Featured selection: hybrid (manual + fallback)

## Architecture Decisions Summary

### **CSV as Source of Truth**
- **Flow**: CSV â†’ JSON â†’ Website
- **Location**: `/data/blog-metadata.csv`
- **Version Control**: Git-tracked
- **Future**: Potential web UI for management

### **Dual Timestamp System**
- **workDate**: When content was actually created (canonical for narrative ordering)
- **pubDate**: When published on Medium (for insights and freshness)
- **Rationale**: Story happened out of chronological order (backfilled historical posts)

### **Binary Category System**
- **Narrative**: Building-in-public story, chronological developments
- **Insight**: Standalone lessons, methodology frameworks
- **Rationale**: Clear mental model, enables distinct navigation paths

### **Narrative Clustering**
- **Concept**: Group narrative posts into named "chapters"
- **Examples**: "Weekend Sprint #1", "Ethics Framework", "Image Pipeline"
- **Impact**: Makes 155+ posts navigable, tells story arc

---

## Technical Highlights

### **Slug Generation Algorithm** (Pseudo-code)
```javascript
function generateSlug(title, existingSlugs, maxWords = 6) {
  // Extract text before colon
  const textBeforeColon = title.split(':')[0].trim();

  // Split into words and sanitize
  const words = textBeforeColon
    .toLowerCase()
    .replace(/[^a-z0-9\s-]/g, '') // Remove special chars
    .split(/\s+/)
    .filter(word => word.length > 0);

  // Try with increasing word counts
  for (let wordCount = Math.min(words.length, maxWords);
       wordCount <= words.length;
       wordCount++) {
    const slug = words.slice(0, wordCount).join('-');

    if (!existingSlugs.includes(slug)) {
      return slug;
    }
  }

  // If all words exhausted, append number
  const baseSlug = words.slice(0, maxWords).join('-');
  let counter = 2;
  while (existingSlugs.includes(`${baseSlug}-${counter}`)) {
    counter++;
  }

  return `${baseSlug}-${counter}`;
}
```

### **Featured Article Logic**
```typescript
function getFeaturedPost(posts: BlogPost[]): BlogPost {
  // Try to find manually featured post
  const featured = posts.find(p => p.featured === true);
  if (featured) return featured;

  // Fallback to most recent by pub date
  return posts.sort((a, b) =>
    new Date(b.pubDate).getTime() - new Date(a.pubDate).getTime()
  )[0];
}
```

## Open Tasks for User (Before Phase 5)

These can be done in parallel with Phase 4 implementation:

1. **Classify Posts**: Review all 155 posts and categorize as Narrative or Insight
2. **Determine Work Dates**: Assign work dates to all posts (can be approximate)
3. **Define Clusters**: Identify narrative clusters and name them
   - Examples: "Weekend Sprint #1", "Ethics Framework", "Image Pipeline"
4. **Choose Featured Post**: Select one post to feature on homepage
5. **Legacy Image Alignment** (optional): Align past images to robot-[word].webp format
