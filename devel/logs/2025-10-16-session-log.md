# Session Log: 2025-10-16 (Thursday)

**Start Time:** 11:08 AM Pacific
**Working On:** Recover Phase 9/10 work and perfect publishing workflow

## Session Overview

Continuing from yesterday's session where we fixed the Medium URL regression and added chatDate field. Today we need to recover stashed Phase 9/10 work (episode navigation + featured post) and then perfect the publishing workflow.

## Session Goals

Three steps in priority order:
1. **Apply stashed Phase 9/10 work** (episode navigation + featured post on homepage)
2. **Perfect the publishing workflow** (systematize new post process)
3. **Polish pass** (navigation, layout bugs, design refinement)

## Current State

### Completed Yesterday (2025-10-15)
- ✅ Fixed Medium URL regression (all 160 posts now use local `/blog/slug` URLs)
- ✅ Added chatDate field to CSV metadata (tracks when article draft created)
- ✅ Fixed corrupted dates (156 entries corrected from 2001 → 2025)
- ✅ Fixed incorrect imageSlugs (99 entries updated)
- ✅ Added 4 missing posts to CSV
- ✅ Enhanced RSS script with warnings for missing CSV metadata
- ✅ Deployed successfully to pipermorgan.ai

### Issue Discovered This Morning
- Homepage missing featured/recent blog post section
- **Root Cause**: Phase 9/10 work from Oct 13 got stashed (stash@{0}) but never committed
- FeaturedPost component exists (`src/components/organisms/FeaturedPost.tsx`) but not integrated
- Episode navigation features also in stash, not applied

### Git Status
```
stash@{0}: WIP on main: f44f8b0e Implement Phase 8: Narrative Clustering - Episode Metadata
stash@{1}: WIP on main: 472d6e8 Add Journey navigation link and transform blog post cards
```

Phase 9/10 work includes:
- Episode filter dropdown on blog page
- Episode overview page (`/blog/episodes`)
- Grouped view toggle (list vs. episode-grouped)
- FeaturedPost component on homepage
- Episode badges on blog post cards
- Work date chronology fixes

## Publishing Workflow Gaps Identified

From yesterday's experience with missing metadata:
- **No checklist** for publishing new posts to Medium
- **No validation** to catch missing CSV metadata before deployment
- **Manual process** for adding posts to CSV (error-prone)
- **No verification step** in RSS workflow
- **Unclear handoff** between Medium publish and CSV update

Need to systematize:
1. New post checklist/automation when publishing to Medium
2. Validation scripts to catch missing metadata before deployment
3. Better RSS/CSV synchronization process
4. Publishing workflow documentation

- User confirmed 3-step plan: (1) Apply stashed work, (2) Perfect publishing workflow, (3) Polish pass

### 11:15 AM - Investigation Complete
- Located stashed Phase 9/10 work in `stash@{0}`

- Identified files needing integration:
  - Homepage missing FeaturedPost section
  - BlogContent missing episode filtering
  - BlogPostCard missing episode badges
  - Components not exported properly

### 11:20 AM - Phase 10 (Featured Post) Integration Started
**Goal**: Restore featured article functionality on homepage

**Changes Made**:
1. Added `getFeaturedPost()` function to `src/lib/blog-utils.ts`
   - Hybrid selection strategy: manual featured=true OR fallback to most recent
   - Leverages existing `sortByWorkDate()` function
   
2. Updated `src/components/index.ts`
   - Exported FeaturedPost component and props type
   
3. Updated `src/app/page.tsx`
   - Imported FeaturedPost, getFeaturedPost, and mediumPosts
   - Added featured post selection logic
   - Added FeaturedPost section right after Hero section
   - Passes all required props: title, excerpt, dates, category, cluster, etc.

4. Updated `scripts/sync-csv-to-json.js`
   - Added featured field syncing from CSV to JSON
   - Converts string 'true' to boolean true
   
5. Regenerated `src/data/medium-posts.json`
   - Ran sync script successfully
   - All 160 posts now have featured field (defaults to false)
   - 65 posts updated with new metadata

**Verification**:
- TypeScript type-check: ✅ PASSED (no errors)
- All Phase 10 infrastructure restored
- Homepage will now show featured/most recent post

### Status: Phase 10 Complete ✅

**Next**: Apply Phase 9 (Episode Navigation) features from stash
