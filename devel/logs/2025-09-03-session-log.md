- ✅ Privacy compliance

**Performance Impact**: <50ms per integration, well under 100ms requirement
**Security**: No exposed secrets, privacy-compliant implementation
**Cost**: $0 stack maintained (all services within free tiers)

## 7:45 AM - GA4 Setup Instructions & Cross-Domain Configuration

User obtained GA4 measurement ID `G-SVPLRHEEBP` and needed guidance on:
1. Cross-domain tracking setup in GA4 console
2. Jekyll integration for pmorgan.tech (GitHub Pages from docs/)
3. Environment variable deployment process

### Cross-Domain Setup Completed
- User successfully navigated to GA4 "Configure your domains" interface
- Guided through adding `pmorgan.tech` to cross-domain linking configuration  
- Primary domain `pipermorgan.ai` automatically included as GA4 property base
- Match type "Contains" properly configured for subdomain flexibility

### Jekyll Integration Researched (8:24 AM)
- pmorgan.tech served from `docs/` directory via Jekyll/GitHub Pages
- Implementation approach identified:
  - Add `google_analytics: G-SVPLRHEEBP` to `_config.yml`
  - Create `_includes/google-analytics.html` with privacy-compliant GA4 code
  - Include in layout with production environment check
- User will implement after meetings

### Environment Configuration Status
- ✅ Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-SVPLRHEEBP` to `.env.local`
- User questioned deployment process for environment variables
- `.env.local` stays local (not committed) - only `.env.example` goes to repo
- Deployment requires setting environment variable in production (Vercel/Netlify/etc.)
