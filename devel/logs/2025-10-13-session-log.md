## Actions Taken

### Phase 9: Cluster Navigation - COMPLETED ✅

**1. Fixed Critical Work Date Encoding Issue (2001 → 2025)**
- Identified root cause: CSV dates without years defaulted to 2001
- Updated `scripts/sync-csv-to-json.js` with date normalization functions
- Added `normalizeDateTo2025()` and `formatDate()` functions
- Re-ran sync script: 146 posts updated successfully
- Verified: Posts now show correct 2025 dates (June-October timeline)
- Files modified: `/scripts/sync-csv-to-json.js`, `/src/data/medium-posts.json`

**2. Created Episode Infrastructure**
- Created `/src/lib/episodes.ts` with TypeScript episode definitions
- Defined all 12 episodes with metadata (slug, name, dates, description, theme)
- Added utility functions: `getEpisode()`, `getEpisodeNumber()`, `getEpisodeCounts()`
- Established consistent episode data across entire site

**3. Implemented Episode Filtering**
- Added episode dropdown filter to blog page (`/src/app/blog/BlogContent.tsx`)
- Implemented combined category + episode filtering logic
- Added URL parameter support for episode filtering (`?episode=slug`)
- Added Suspense boundary for client-side navigation
- Added "View All Episodes" CTA button for discoverability

**4. Created Episode Overview Page**
- Built comprehensive episode landing page at `/blog/episodes`
- Displays all 12 episodes in responsive grid layout
- Shows episode metadata: number, name, description, date range, theme

- Smooth toggle between flat list and grouped display
- Both views respect category and episode filters

### Technical Details

## Phase 10: Featured Article on Homepage - COMPLETED ✅

**1. Featured Field Infrastructure**
- Updated `scripts/sync-csv-to-json.js` to sync `featured` boolean from CSV to JSON
- Ran sync script: All 156 posts now have `featured` field (default: false)
- CSV already had `featured` column prepared
- Files modified: `/scripts/sync-csv-to-json.js`, `/src/data/medium-posts.json`

**2. Created FeaturedPost Component**
- Built hero-style `FeaturedPost` organism component
- Features:
  - Large two-column layout (content + image)
  - Featured badge with star icon
  - Episode and category badges
  - Dual date display (work date + pub date)
  - Two CTAs: "Read Full Article" and "View All Posts"

- Exported from `/src/components/index.ts`

**3. Implemented Featured Article Selection Logic**
- Added `getFeaturedPost()` utility to `/src/lib/blog-utils.ts`
- **Hybrid Selection Strategy**:
  1. **Primary**: Find post with `featured=true` in CSV
  2. **Fallback**: Return most recent post by work date
- Leverages existing `sortByWorkDate()` function
- Returns null-safe result

**4. Integrated Featured Section on Homepage**
- Added featured article section to `/src/app/page.tsx`
- Positioned between Hero and "What we're doing" sections
- Auto-selects featured post using hybrid logic

### Statistics
- **Selection Strategy**: Hybrid (manual override + automatic fallback)

### How to Feature an Article
To manually feature an article, edit `/data/blog-metadata.csv`:
1. Set `featured` column to `true` for desired post
2. Ensure only ONE post has `featured=true`
3. Run: `node scripts/sync-csv-to-json.js`
4. Featured post will appear on homepage
