## Issue: Layout Regression - Content Left Alignment

### Problem Description
- Layout regression has occurred where site content is left-aligned instead of centered
- This was a bug that previously took days to fix
- Suspected culprit: code related to logo/type lockup alignment at top of page
- Need to investigate what caused the regression and fix it

### Investigation Plan
1. âœ… Create session log
2. ðŸ”„ Check past logs for previous fix details
3. ðŸ”„ Examine current layout state
4. ðŸ”„ Identify root cause of regression
5. ðŸ”„ Check for other broken elements
6. ðŸ”„ Apply fix

### Timeline
- **Started**: 2025-09-10
- **Status**: In Progress

## Investigation Log

### Root Cause Identified âœ…
**Problem**: Layout regression where site content is left-aligned instead of centered.

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent container class usage between components:
- **Layout CSS** (layout.tsx:126): Defines `.site-container` class with proper centering (`margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto`)
- **Hero Component** (Hero.tsx:57): Still uses `'container mx-auto px-4'` class
- **Other Components**: Were updated to use `site-container` (Navigation, Footer, page.tsx sections)

**Technical Details**:
- The `.container` class referenced in Hero.tsx:57 **does not exist** in the CSS
- Only `.site-container` is defined with proper centering styles
- This causes the Hero section (homepage) to appear left-aligned
- Other components using `site-container` display correctly

**Why it Regressed**: 
- Files were partially updated to use `site-container` instead of `container mx-auto px-4`
- Hero component was missed in the update, creating the inconsistency
- Previous CSS fix (2025-09-05) properly removed the broad `p,div,span` rule, but this Hero component issue is separate

### Fix Applied âœ…

**Hero Component Fix**:
- Updated `Hero.tsx:57` to use `site-container` instead of `'container mx-auto px-4'`

**Systematic Fix Across Codebase**:
- Identified 10 additional files using undefined `container` classes
- Fixed 29+ instances of `'container mx-auto px-4'` â†’ `'site-container'`
- Files fixed: privacy/page.tsx, what-weve-learned/page.tsx, not-found.tsx, newsletter/page.tsx, how-it-works/page.tsx, get-involved/page.tsx, about/page.tsx, BlogErrorBoundary.tsx, HomePageBlog.tsx, BlogContent.tsx

**Verification**:
- âœ… Development server runs successfully (localhost:3001)
- âœ… TypeScript errors unrelated to layout changes (pre-existing API route issues)
- âœ… ESLint issues unrelated to layout changes (pre-existing content escaping issues)

### Root Cause Analysis Complete

**What Caused the Regression**:
1. Files were partially updated to use `site-container` (Navigation, Footer, page.tsx)
2. Hero component and many other pages were missed in the update
3. This created inconsistency where some components used proper `site-container` while others used undefined `container` classes
4. Result: Pages with undefined classes appeared left-aligned instead of centered

**Why Previous Fix Didn't Address This**:
- The 2025-09-05 fix correctly removed the broad `p,div,span` CSS rule
- But that was a separate issue from this container class inconsistency
- Both issues caused left-alignment but had different root causes

**Current Status**: âœ… **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**
- All components now use the properly defined `site-container` class
- Consistent centering and responsive behavior across the entire site
- No undefined CSS classes remaining
