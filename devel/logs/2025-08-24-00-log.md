# Development Session Log - 2025-08-24-00

## Session Start
- **Time**: 2025-08-24 16:47 PM
- **Task**: Implement strategic cross-links to technical documentation and create post-designer meeting GitHub issues
- **Context**: Following up on soft launch architecture completion, adding technical pathways and finalizing launch readiness plan

## Current Status
- Site architecture transformation complete (4-page professional structure)
- Content solid and near-final for soft launch
- Need strategic cross-links to pmorgan.tech for technical users
- Designer meeting scheduled to define final polish requirements

## Progress Log

### 4:47 PM - Strategic Cross-Links Implementation
- âœ… **Homepage Technical Credibility**: Added section after Current Reality Check with pmorgan.tech link
- âœ… **How It Works Implementation Details**: Added prominent CTA section after methodology patterns
- âœ… **Footer Developer Resources**: Added new "Developers" section with Technical Docs and GitHub links
- âœ… **Build Testing**: All TypeScript checks passing, deployment successful

### Strategic Placement Logic
- **Homepage**: Technical users see credibility proof immediately after value proposition
- **How It Works**: Natural progression from "what it does" to "how it's built"  
- **Footer**: Standard location developers expect for technical resources
- **Result**: Multiple entry points without overwhelming non-technical users

## 9:06 PM - Post-Designer Meeting Extension

### Designer Meeting Outcomes
- âœ… **Design readiness confirmed**: Site structure ready for final visual polish pass
- âœ… **Accessibility concerns identified**: Bright teal link color needs contrast audit
