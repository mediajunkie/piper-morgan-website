## Implementation Notes for Claude Code

### Content Preservation
- **Keep all existing insights content** (The Biggest Surprise, Context Problem, etc.)
- **Add Christian's bio section** as credibility anchor before insights
- **Enhance newsletter CTA** with specific methodology value proposition

### SEO Updates
```jsx
const seoData = generateSEOMetadata(
  'What We\'ve Learned - AI Development Insights by Christian Crumlish',
  'Discoveries from three months of systematic AI development that counter conventional wisdom. Practical insights for PM and UX leaders from building-in-public methodology development.',
  { canonical: 'https://pipermorgan.ai/what-weve-learned' }
);
```

### Technical Requirements
1. **301 Redirect**: Set up `/about` → `/what-weve-learned` 
2. **Enhanced ConvertKit tagging**: Add `source-what-weve-learned` tag to newsletter signup
3. **Social links**: Include Christian's professional links in bio section
4. **Mobile optimization**: Ensure bio grid stacks properly on mobile

### Content Hierarchy
1. **Hero**: Sets expectation for insights with author credibility
2. **Christian's bio**: Establishes expertise and context 
3. **Social proof**: Community validation
4. **Existing insights**: All current discovery content
5. **Newsletter CTA**: Methodology-focused value proposition

This enhancement positions the insights within Christian's professional credibility while maintaining all existing content value and optimizing for newsletter conversion with methodology-specific messaging.
