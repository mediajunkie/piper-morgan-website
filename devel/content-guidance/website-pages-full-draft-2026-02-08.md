### Hero

**THINK BIGGER**

Piper holds the threads so you can focus on the decision.

[Try Piper Morgan]

---

### Positioning Section

Task managers assume work is items in lists. But your work is connections — between people, projects, and priorities at every scale. Decisions ripple. Timelines interlock.

Piper is built for that reality.

---

### What Piper Does

**Your morning, synthesized**

Piper pulls together what happened overnight — GitHub activity, calendar shifts, Slack threads — and surfaces what actually matters for your day. Not a firehose. A briefing.

**Decisions with full context**

When you're weighing a tradeoff, Piper brings the relevant history: past decisions, stakeholder concerns, timeline impacts. The background you'd have if you could remember everything.

**Tools that talk to each other**

Piper connects to where your work already lives — GitHub, Notion, Slack, Google Calendar — and sees the relationships between them. No migration required.

**Learning your world**

Over time, Piper learns your projects, your patterns, your priorities. Not by reading your documents — by understanding how things connect.

---

### Why Trust Us

**Built in public, from day one**

Every breakthrough and setback documented. 160+ blog posts. Weekly progress reports. No marketing polish — just the real story of building AI that works.

**Ethics as architecture**

We don't just have policies about responsible AI. We built ethical constraints directly into Piper's foundation. Some behaviors aren't discouraged — they're impossible.

**Methodology you can see**

Our development approach is documented, tested, and open. We call it the Excellence Flywheel. You can read exactly how we work.

## /try — Branching Page

### How ready are you?

Piper Morgan is in active development. Some people want to dive in now and help shape it. Others prefer to wait until things are smoother.

Both are good. Which sounds like you?

---

**[I'm ready to get my hands dirty]**

Join our alpha testers. You'll need to set up a local development environment, and things will break sometimes. But you'll be among the first to experience what we're building — and your feedback will directly shape Piper's development.

→ Join the alpha

---

**[Keep me posted]**

Join the beta waitlist. We'll let you know when Piper is ready for broader testing — probably in the next few months. No setup required. Just leave your email and we'll reach out when it's time.

→ Join the waitlist

## /try/alpha — Alpha Signup

### Welcome to the alpha

You're joining a small group of people who are helping shape Piper Morgan while it's still taking form. This is hands-on, early-stage work.

---

**What to expect**

- **Setup required**: You'll install Piper locally using our developer documentation
- **Things will break**: We're iterating fast; bugs are part of the process
- **Your voice matters**: Alpha feedback directly influences what we build next
- **Real access**: You'll use Piper for your actual work, not a sandbox

---

**What we're looking for**

- Comfort with technical setup (command line, environment variables, Docker optional)
- Willingness to report what's working and what isn't
- Interest in AI-assisted product management
- Patience with rough edges

---

**Ready?**

### Why contribute to Piper Morgan?

**Shape something early**  
This isn't a mature product looking for free labor. It's an active experiment in human-AI collaboration, and your input genuinely influences direction.

**Learn in public**  
Our development methodology is documented in detail. Contributing means learning how we approach systematic AI development — and helping refine it.

**Build your portfolio**  
Open source contributions you can point to. Blog posts about what you learned. A project with a public track record.

## /methodology — How We Work

### The Excellence Flywheel

Building AI that actually helps requires more than good intentions. It requires systematic methodology — the kind that compounds over time.

We call our approach the Excellence Flywheel.

---

**Verification before implementation**

Before writing code, we verify assumptions. Check existing patterns. Understand what's actually there. This takes longer at the start and saves time everywhere else.

**Tests before features**

We write the test first. Not because it's trendy, but because it forces clarity about what "working" actually means. If you can't test it, you don't understand it yet.

**Documentation as you go**

Decisions get documented when they're made, not reconstructed later. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture the why, not just the what.

**Cross-validation by default**

Different AI agents check each other's work. One builds, another validates. Mistakes get caught before they compound.

**Systematic kindness**

Excellence doesn't have to be harsh. Our methodology assumes good intentions, explains the why, and makes learning feel safe. Rigor and warmth aren't opposites.

---

### Why this matters for AI

Most AI development moves fast and breaks things. That works until it doesn't — until the accumulated shortcuts create systems that are fragile, opaque, or harmful.

We're building something meant to last. Something meant to be trusted. That requires a different pace and a different discipline.

The methodology is the product.

### Want to go deeper?

Our full methodology documentation is available on pmorgan.tech, including:
- The Excellence Flywheel framework

## /about — Project Story

### What is Piper Morgan?

Piper Morgan is an AI-powered product management assistant — a colleague who helps you stay on top of everything without losing sight of what matters.

But that's not quite the whole story.

---

### The experiment

Piper Morgan started as a question: *What if we built an AI assistant according to our actual values, instead of optimizing for engagement metrics?*

No venture funding. No growth targets. No pressure to ship fast and fix later. Just one product manager with decades of experience, a $0 infrastructure stack, and the time to do things right.

The result is an ongoing experiment in ethical AI development, documented in public from day one.

---

### Who's behind this

**Christian Crumlish** (xian) has been building social software and digital products since the web was young. Yahoo. Grubhub. Typepad. Co-author of *Designing Social Interfaces* (O'Reilly). Currently exploring what it means to have AI as a genuine collaborator rather than just a tool.

Piper Morgan is built with significant help from Claude (Anthropic) and a methodology that treats AI agents as professional colleagues — with appropriate boundaries.

---

### The name

Piper Morgan is named in the tradition of AI assistants with human names, but with intention. Piper suggests someone who leads, who sets a tempo. Morgan suggests wisdom, guidance, mentorship. Together: a colleague who helps you think bigger.

(And yes, there's a bit of a wink at "PM" in the initials.)

---

### Where this is going

The immediate goal: a working tool that helps product managers do their jobs better.

The larger ambition: demonstrating that AI development can be thoughtful, transparent, and humane — that you don't have to choose between capability and ethics.

We're building in public because we think the process matters as much as the product. Maybe more.

## Notes for PM Review

**Tone check**: Aimed for confident but not boastful. "We know what we're building and why" without overselling.

**Length**: Homepage is the longest. Other pages are intentionally lighter — enough to orient, not overwhelming.

**CTAs**: Tried to make each page's primary action clear. Let me know if any feel buried.

**Placeholders**: 
- Email addresses (alpha@, contribute@) — confirm these exist or adjust
- Playbook nav item — currently noted as hidden until ready
- Form fields on /try/beta — will need actual implementation

**Questions for you**:
1. Is the /about tone right? It's more personal than the other pages.
2. /methodology — too much? too little? The "systematic kindness" line felt important to include.
3. /try branching — does "How ready are you?" frame it well, or too much pressure?
