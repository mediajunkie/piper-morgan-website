# CXO Copy Guidance Summary

**To**: Communications Director  
**From**: CXO  
**Date**: February 8, 2026  
**Re**: Homepage copy decisions — go forward with drafting

---

## Approved Direction

### Hero Headline
**"Think bigger"** — approved as-is. Two words, no additions. The confidence of brevity signals "we know what we are."

### Hero Subhead
**"Piper holds the threads so you can focus on the decision."** — approved as-is.

### Positioning Paragraph
**Full version** — use on homepage (shorter version acceptable for constrained contexts like mobile/ads/social):

> Task managers assume work is items in lists. But your work is connections — between people, projects, and priorities at every scale. Decisions ripple. Timelines interlock.
>
> Piper is built for that reality.

## Key Decisions

| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| "Think bigger" | ✓ Approved | Works like "Think Different" — meaning unfolds via subhead |
| Threads vs strands | **Threads** | PM vocabulary ("don't lose the thread"), validates mental model |
| Positioning length | **Full paragraph** | Homepage has room; does real work naming the insight |
| "Decision" as anchor word | ✓ Approved | Concrete, elevating; honors PMs as decision-makers not task-doers |

---

## Rejected Alternatives

- "Your AI colleague holds the strands. You hold the vision." — "Vision" overpromises; "decision" is more grounded
- Shorter positioning on homepage — save for constrained contexts
- Adding qualifiers to headline — would undercut confidence

## Recommended Full Hero Block

```
THINK BIGGER

Piper holds the threads so you can focus on the decision.

[Try Piper Morgan]

Task managers assume work is items in lists. But your work 
is connections — between people, projects, and priorities 
at every scale. Decisions ripple. Timelines interlock.

Piper is built for that reality.
