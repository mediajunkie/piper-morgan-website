# Piper Morgan Site Architecture - Soft Launch + Evolution Strategy

## Design Philosophy

**Graceful Evolution**: Structure that works perfectly for soft launch but can expand naturally as the project grows, community develops, and capabilities mature.

**Future-Proofing**: URL structure and information architecture that won't break as we add alpha testing, community features, and hosted content.

**Clear Pathways**: Obvious places for people to engage at their comfort level - from curious followers to active alpha testers.
