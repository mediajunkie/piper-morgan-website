# Medium Export Parser - Results Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Script:** `scripts/parse-medium-export.js`

## ✅ Mission Accomplished

Successfully parsed 157 published Building Piper Morgan posts from Medium export and created complete self-hosted blog archive.

## 📊 Final Numbers

- **162 total posts** in archive
  - 152 from Medium export (HTML files)
  - 10 from RSS feed (most recent)
  - Deduplicated by GUID
- **148 images** downloaded and self-hosted
- **7 pages** of pagination (24 posts per page)

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. Parser Script (`scripts/parse-medium-export.js`)
- **CSV Processing**: Extracts post IDs from Medium URLs
- **HTML Parsing**: Extracts metadata, content, and featured images
- **Image Downloading**: Downloads images with redirect following and rate limiting
- **Data Merging**: Combines export data with RSS feed, deduplicates
- **ISO Date Formatting**: Proper date handling for sorting

### 2. Complete Archive (`src/data/medium-posts.json`)
```json
{
  "title": "Post Title",
  "link": "https://medium.com/building-piper-morgan/...",
  "pubDate": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 13:55:10 GMT",
  "isoDate": "2025-10-08T13:55:10.000Z",
  "author": "christian crumlish",
  "content": "First few paragraphs...",
  "contentSnippet": "First 300 chars excerpt...",
  "guid": "https://medium.com/...",
  "categories": ["Building in Public"],
  "theme": "building" or "insight",
  "thumbnail": "/assets/blog-images/{postId}-featured.png"
}
```

### 3. Self-Hosted Images (`public/assets/blog-images/`)
- 148 featured images downloaded from Medium CDN
- Stored with pattern: `{postId}-featured.png`
- All references updated to local paths

## 🔧 Technical Solutions

### Problem 1: ES Module Compatibility
**Issue:** Project uses `"type": "module"` in package.json
**Solution:** Rewrote script to use `import`/`export` instead of `require`

### Problem 2: Image Download Failures
**Issue:**
- 301 redirects not followed
- 429 rate limiting after ~30 requests

**Solution:**
- Added redirect following for 301/302/307 status codes
- Added 250ms delay between image downloads
- Recursive retry with redirect count limit

### Problem 3: Date Formatting
**Issue:** Various date formats in CSV and HTML
**Solution:**
- Parse dates from multiple sources
- Convert to ISO 8601 for sorting
- Store both human-readable and ISO formats

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `scripts/parse-medium-export.js` - Main parser script
- `public/assets/blog-images/` - Directory with 148 images
- `scripts/PARSER-RESULTS.md` - This summary

**Modified:**
- `src/data/medium-posts.json` - Now contains 162 posts (was 10)
- `package.json` - Added `csv-parse` dependency

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Visit blog**: http://localhost:3000/blog
3. **Test pagination**: Should show 7 pages (6 full + 1 partial)
4. **Verify images**: All featured images should load from local storage

## 🔄 Ongoing Automation

The existing RSS automation will continue to:
- Fetch latest posts from Medium RSS
- Merge with existing archive
- Deduplicate by GUID
- Keep archive up-to-date automatically

## 📈 Impact

**Before:**
- 10 posts (RSS only)
- External Medium CDN images
- No pagination needed

**After:**
- 162 posts (full archive)
- Self-hosted images
- 7 pages of blog content
