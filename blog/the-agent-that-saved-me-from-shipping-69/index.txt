GREAT-4C needed completion: add spatial intelligence to the five canonical handlers, implement error handling, enhance the cache monitoring we‚Äôd discovered Sunday. Estimated effort: a few hours of systematic implementation following proven patterns.</p><p>By 9:00 AM, GREAT-4C was complete. One hour and thirty-nine minutes from session start to final validation. All seven acceptance criteria met. The multi-user foundation was operational‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno more hardcoded references to specific users, just spatial intelligence providing context-appropriate detail¬†levels.</p><p>Part of me doesn‚Äôt love it when I can‚Äôt finish the chunk of work I started in the same day, so it felt good to wrap up GREAT-4C before plunging ahead to GREAT-4D: implementing the remaining intent handlers.</p><p>The gameplan said we needed two categories. EXECUTION and ANALYSIS‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe handlers for ‚Äúcreate a GitHub issue‚Äù and ‚Äúanalyze this data‚Äù type requests.</p><p>By 2:05 PM, we‚Äôd discovered the actual scope: thirteen intent categories, not¬†two.</p><p>And if the Code agent hadn‚Äôt caught the gap during Phase Z validation that we do while tidying up when we think a job is done, we would have shipped thinking we had 100% coverage when we actually had¬†69%.</p><h3>Morning: The work that goes according to¬†plan</h3><p>GREAT-4C‚Äôs goal was removing the last obstacles to multi-user support. The canonical handlers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthose five categories (TEMPORAL, STATUS, PRIORITY, GUIDANCE, IDENTITY) that could respond without querying the LLM‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall had hardcoded references to the configuration details of a specific user, our only user so far,¬†me.</p><p>The spatial intelligence integration followed a clear pattern. Each handler needed¬†to:</p><ol><li>Check the spatial context for detail level (GRANULAR, EMBEDDED, or¬†DEFAULT)</li><li>Format responses appropriately (15 characters for embedded, 250‚Äì550 for granular)</li><li>Gracefully degrade if spatial data unavailable</li><li>Maintain sub-millisecond performance</li></ol><p>Code agent implemented this across all five handlers in¬†phases:</p><ul><li>STATUS handler: 7:30 AM (5¬†minutes)</li><li>PRIORITY handler: 7:37 AM (3¬†minutes)</li><li>TEMPORAL handler: 7:40 AM (3¬†minutes)</li><li>GUIDANCE handler: 7:43 AM (3¬†minutes)</li><li>IDENTITY handler: 7:46 AM (3¬†minutes)</li></ul><p>Total implementation time: 17¬†minutes.</p><p>If we expected something to take an hour and the bots say it took five minutes, I get suspicious and want to see more proof, but 17 minutes feels pretty solid. I still scrutinize the reports to make sure they‚Äôre taking no shortcuts and not dismissing some difficulties as unimportant and OK to ignore or postpone.</p><p>Any actual speed was the result of clarity. Each handler followed the same pattern. The spatial intelligence system already existed from GREAT-2. The formatters were tested. The only new work was connecting pieces that already fit together.</p><p>By 8:15 AM, Cursor had completed error handling‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägraceful degradation when calendars fail to load, files go missing, or data comes back empty. By 8:30 AM, Code had enhanced the cache monitoring we‚Äôd discovered Sunday (two-layer architecture: file-level and session-level caching both operational).</p><p>At 9:00 AM, my Lead Developer declared GREAT-4C complete. All acceptance criteria met in 1 hour 39¬†minutes.</p><p>This is what systematic work looks like when foundations are solid. Not heroic effort, just clear patterns executed cleanly. Just don‚Äôt let me brag about this too much. NO SPOILERS but we did later find a few¬†gaps.</p><h3>The scope gap discovery</h3><p>GREAT-4D started at 10:20 AM with what looked like straightforward scope: implement handlers for EXECUTION and ANALYSIS intent categories.</p><p>The investigation phase revealed something unexpected. Lead Developer ran filesystem checks looking for the placeholder code that would need replacing:</p><pre>grep -r &quot;[A KEYWORD THAT WAS MENTIONED]&quot; services/<br>grep -r &quot;TODO.*EXECUTION&quot; services/<br>grep -r &quot;placeholder.*ANALYSIS&quot; services/</pre><p>Results: No matches found.¬†Hmm.</p><p>This triggered the GREAT-1 truth investigation. What does the system actually do when it receives EXECUTION or ANALYSIS¬†intents?</p><p>The answer: Routes to workflow handlers through QueryRouter, not canonical handlers.</p><p>But QueryRouter had been replaced by the workflow factory during GREAT-1. The old routing was gone. The new routing existed but had never been validated for these categories.</p><p>Testing revealed the actual state: _handle_generic_intent contained a placeholder that returned &quot;I can help with that!&quot; for EXECUTION and ANALYSIS requests without actually executing or analyzing anything.</p><p>Not a complete failure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe system didn‚Äôt crash. Just quietly pretended to work while doing nothing. We would have caught this next time I did end-to-end testing, but that would have set off an archaeological expedition to figure out just when and where we had left something unfinished.</p><p>This was our chance to fix it¬†now.</p><h3>The thirteen-category realization</h3><p>At 12:25 PM, Chief Architect redefined GREAT-4D with simplified scope following the QUERY pattern. Implement EXECUTION and ANALYSIS handlers the same way QUERY worked: delegate to the workflow orchestrator, handle the response, return¬†results.</p><p>Code agent deployed for Phase 1 at 12:36 PM. By 12:42 PM, EXECUTION handler was complete with the placeholder removed. Cursor completed ANALYSIS handler by 1:02 PM. Testing validated both worked correctly by 1:22¬†PM.</p><p>Everything looked complete.</p><p>Then at 1:40 PM, during Phase Z final validation, Lead Developer discovered something: four additional categories were returning placeholders.</p><p>SYNTHESIS, STRATEGY, LEARNING, UNKNOWN‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall routing to _handle_generic_intent which still contained placeholder logic.</p><p>How had this escaped us? Anyhow, we caught it just in¬†time!</p><p>The math:</p><ul><li>8 categories implemented in GREAT-4A through¬†GREAT-4C</li><li>2 categories just implemented in GREAT-4D Phases¬†1‚Äì2</li><li>4 categories discovered in Phase¬†Z</li><li>Total: 14 categories (13 real + UNKNOWN fallback)</li></ul><p>Shipping after Phase 2 would have meant: 10/13 categories working = 77% coverage, not¬†100%.</p><p>But we thought we were done. The gameplan said ‚Äúimplement EXECUTION and ANALYSIS‚Äù and we‚Äôd done a form of that. The gap wasn‚Äôt in execution‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was in understanding the actual¬†scope.</p><h3>The autonomous decision</h3><p>At 1:42 PM, Code agent made an autonomous decision.</p><p>Instead of reporting the gap and waiting for new instructions, Code self-initiated implementation of the four missing handlers:</p><pre>SYNTHESIS: Combine information from multiple sources<br>STRATEGY: Develop plans or approaches  <br>LEARNING: Capture knowledge or lessons<br>UNKNOWN: Handle unclassifiable requests gracefully</pre><p>This wasn‚Äôt some sort of emergent go-getter-ism, but a weird side effect of context-window management. When Code‚Äôs window gets too full it ‚Äúcompacts‚Äù the context, digesting it to a summary. During these several minute exercises it effectively goes into a fugue state and then recovers, reads the summary and¬†resumes.</p><p>This time compaction happened just as it was writing it‚Äôs Phase 0 (investigation) report. The drill is we (the Lead Dev and I) review the report and then provide a prompt for Phase 1.

GREAT-4C needed completion: add spatial intelligence to the five canonical handlers, implement error handling, enhance the cache monitoring we‚Äôd discovered Sunday. Estimated effort: a few hours of systematic implementation following proven patterns.</p><p>By 9:00 AM, GREAT-4C was complete. One hour and thirty-nine minutes from session start to final validation. All seven acceptance criteria met. The multi-user foundation was operational‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno more hardcoded references to specific users, just spatial intelligence providing context-appropriate detail¬†levels.</p><p>Part of me doesn‚Äôt love it when I can‚Äôt finish the chunk of work I started in the same day, so it felt good to wrap up GREAT-4C before plunging ahead to GREAT-4D: implementing the remaining intent handlers.</p><p>The gameplan said we needed two categories. EXECUTION and ANALYSIS‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe handlers for ‚Äúcreate a GitHub issue‚Äù and ‚Äúanalyze this data‚Äù type requests.</p><p>By 2:05 PM, we‚Äôd discovered the actual scope: thirteen intent categories, not¬†two.</p><p>And if the Code agent hadn‚Äôt caught the gap during Phase Z validation that we do while tidying up when we think a job is done, we would have shipped thinking we had 100% coverage when we actually had¬†69%.</p><h3>Morning: The work that goes according to¬†plan</h3><p>GREAT-4C‚Äôs goal was removing the last obstacles to multi-user support. The canonical handlers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthose five categories (TEMPORAL, STATUS, PRIORITY, GUIDANCE, IDENTITY) that could respond without querying the LLM‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall had hardcoded references to the configuration details of a specific user, our only user so far,¬†me.</p><p>The spatial intelligence integration followed a clear pattern. Each handler needed¬†to:</p><ol><li>Check the spatial context for detail level (GRANULAR, EMBEDDED, or¬†DEFAULT)</li><li>Format responses appropriately (15 characters for embedded, 250‚Äì550 for granular)</li><li>Gracefully degrade if spatial data unavailable</li><li>Maintain sub-millisecond performance</li></ol><p>Code agent implemented this across all five handlers in¬†phases:</p><ul><li>STATUS handler: 7:30 AM (5¬†minutes)</li><li>PRIORITY handler: 7:37 AM (3¬†minutes)</li><li>TEMPORAL handler: 7:40 AM (3¬†minutes)</li><li>GUIDANCE handler: 7:43 AM (3¬†minutes)</li><li>IDENTITY handler: 7:46 AM (3¬†minutes)</li></ul><p>Total implementation time: 17¬†minutes.</p><p>If we expected something to take an hour and the bots say it took five minutes, I get suspicious and want to see more proof, but 17 minutes feels pretty solid. I still scrutinize the reports to make sure they‚Äôre taking no shortcuts and not dismissing some difficulties as unimportant and OK to ignore or postpone.</p><p>Any actual speed was the result of clarity. Each handler followed the same pattern. The spatial intelligence system already existed from GREAT-2. The formatters were tested. The only new work was connecting pieces that already fit together.</p><p>By 8:15 AM, Cursor had completed error handling‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägraceful degradation when calendars fail to load, files go missing, or data comes back empty. By 8:30 AM, Code had enhanced the cache monitoring we‚Äôd discovered Sunday (two-layer architecture: file-level and session-level caching both operational).</p><p>At 9:00 AM, my Lead Developer declared GREAT-4C complete. All acceptance criteria met in 1 hour 39¬†minutes.</p><p>This is what systematic work looks like when foundations are solid. Not heroic effort, just clear patterns executed cleanly. Just don‚Äôt let me brag about this too much. NO SPOILERS but we did later find a few¬†gaps.</p><h3>The scope gap discovery</h3><p>GREAT-4D started at 10:20 AM with what looked like straightforward scope: implement handlers for EXECUTION and ANALYSIS intent categories.</p><p>The investigation phase revealed something unexpected. Lead Developer ran filesystem checks looking for the placeholder code that would need replacing:</p><pre>grep -r &quot;[A KEYWORD THAT WAS MENTIONED]&quot; services/<br>grep -r &quot;TODO.*EXECUTION&quot; services/<br>grep -r &quot;placeholder.*ANALYSIS&quot; services/</pre><p>Results: No matches found.¬†Hmm.</p><p>This triggered the GREAT-1 truth investigation. What does the system actually do when it receives EXECUTION or ANALYSIS¬†intents?</p><p>The answer: Routes to workflow handlers through QueryRouter, not canonical handlers.</p><p>But QueryRouter had been replaced by the workflow factory during GREAT-1. The old routing was gone. The new routing existed but had never been validated for these categories.</p><p>Testing revealed the actual state: _handle_generic_intent contained a placeholder that returned &quot;I can help with that!&quot; for EXECUTION and ANALYSIS requests without actually executing or analyzing anything.</p><p>Not a complete failure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe system didn‚Äôt crash. Just quietly pretended to work while doing nothing. We would have caught this next time I did end-to-end testing, but that would have set off an archaeological expedition to figure out just when and where we had left something unfinished.</p><p>This was our chance to fix it¬†now.</p><h3>The thirteen-category realization</h3><p>At 12:25 PM, Chief Architect redefined GREAT-4D with simplified scope following the QUERY pattern. Implement EXECUTION and ANALYSIS handlers the same way QUERY worked: delegate to the workflow orchestrator, handle the response, return¬†results.</p><p>Code agent deployed for Phase 1 at 12:36 PM. By 12:42 PM, EXECUTION handler was complete with the placeholder removed. Cursor completed ANALYSIS handler by 1:02 PM. Testing validated both worked correctly by 1:22¬†PM.</p><p>Everything looked complete.</p><p>Then at 1:40 PM, during Phase Z final validation, Lead Developer discovered something: four additional categories were returning placeholders.</p><p>SYNTHESIS, STRATEGY, LEARNING, UNKNOWN‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall routing to _handle_generic_intent which still contained placeholder logic.</p><p>How had this escaped us? Anyhow, we caught it just in¬†time!</p><p>The math:</p><ul><li>8 categories implemented in GREAT-4A through¬†GREAT-4C</li><li>2 categories just implemented in GREAT-4D Phases¬†1‚Äì2</li><li>4 categories discovered in Phase¬†Z</li><li>Total: 14 categories (13 real + UNKNOWN fallback)</li></ul><p>Shipping after Phase 2 would have meant: 10/13 categories working = 77% coverage, not¬†100%.</p><p>But we thought we were done. The gameplan said ‚Äúimplement EXECUTION and ANALYSIS‚Äù and we‚Äôd done a form of that. The gap wasn‚Äôt in execution‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was in understanding the actual¬†scope.</p><h3>The autonomous decision</h3><p>At 1:42 PM, Code agent made an autonomous decision.</p><p>Instead of reporting the gap and waiting for new instructions, Code self-initiated implementation of the four missing handlers:</p><pre>SYNTHESIS: Combine information from multiple sources<br>STRATEGY: Develop plans or approaches  <br>LEARNING: Capture knowledge or lessons<br>UNKNOWN: Handle unclassifiable requests gracefully</pre><p>This wasn‚Äôt some sort of emergent go-getter-ism, but a weird side effect of context-window management. When Code‚Äôs window gets too full it ‚Äúcompacts‚Äù the context, digesting it to a summary. During these several minute exercises it effectively goes into a fugue state and then recovers, reads the summary and¬†resumes.</p><p>This time compaction happened just as it was writing it‚Äôs Phase 0 (investigation) report. The drill is we (the Lead Dev and I) review the report and then provide a prompt for Phase 1. When it woke up from its trance this time, it did not report in to me but just read the gameplan and immediately started working on Phase 1 based on the more general goals (somewhat risky if we don‚Äôt provide a well crafted prompt with guardrails, etc.)</p><p>The agent worked independently for nine minutes. No prompts. No clarification questions.
