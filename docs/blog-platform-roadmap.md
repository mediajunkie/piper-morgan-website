## ðŸš€ Next Phases (Synthesized Roadmap)

### Phase 4: Human-Legible Slugs & URL Structure
**Goal**: Replace 12-character hash IDs with readable article slugs

**Current State**: URLs like `/blog/f38cde251d9d`

   - Consolidate robo* variations (robot-trainer, robot-limb, etc.)
   - Define canonical robo* names
   - Document naming standards

2. **Generate slugs from article titles**
   - Use article-title-up-to-the-colon as slug
   - Handle special characters and spaces
   - Ensure uniqueness across all posts

3. **Update medium-posts.json structure**
   - Add `slug` field to each post
   - Add `imageSlug` field for robo* images
   - Maintain backward compatibility with hash IDs

4. **Update RSS script**
   - Auto-generate slugs for new posts
   - Validate slug uniqueness
   - Map image slugs from CSV

5. **Update routing**
   - Change `/blog/[postId]` to `/blog/[slug]`

**Dependencies**: None

---

### Phase 5: CSV-Driven Publishing Workflow
**Goal**: Establish CSV as source of truth for content metadata and publishing

**Architecture Decision**: CSV â†’ JSON â†’ Website (CSV drives everything)

**Tasks**:
1. **Define CSV schema**
   - Columns: slug, imageSlug, title, workDate, pubDate, category, cluster, featured, notes
   - Document required vs optional fields
   - Establish data validation rules

2. **Create CSV-to-JSON sync script**
   - Read CSV as authoritative source
   - Merge with RSS-pulled data
   - Update medium-posts.json with enriched metadata
   - Validate data integrity

3. **Enhance RSS script with CSV integration**
   - When new post pulled from RSS:
     - Check if slug exists in CSV (pre-planned post)
     - If yes: use imageSlug from CSV
     - If no: generate slug, prompt for CSV update
   - Image handling workflow:
     - Check if image exists at expected path
     - If yes: use it (move to final folder if needed)
     - If no: log warning, create notification

4. **Implement notification system**

## ðŸ“Š Current Platform Status

**Content Coverage**: 155/155 posts (100%)
**Image Coverage**: 155/155 posts (100%)
**Deployment Status**: âœ… Live on production
**RSS Automation**: âœ… Active (daily updates at 7:30 PM UTC)
**Static Pages Generated**: 176 (155 blog posts + 7 pagination + other routes)

**Current URL Structure**: Hash-based IDs (`/blog/f38cde251d9d`)
**Target URL Structure**: Human-legible slugs (`/blog/systemic-kindness-building-methodology`)

**Known Limitations**:
- Blog not in main navigation (by design, pending Phase 9)
- No category filtering (pending Phase 7)
- No search functionality (pending Phase 9)
- No chronological "work date" ordering (pending Phase 6)
- No narrative clustering (pending Phase 8)
- Hash-based URLs instead of readable slugs (pending Phase 4)

**Technical Debt**: None identified (clean Phase 3 implementation)

---

## ðŸ”„ Key Architecture Decisions

### **CSV as Source of Truth**
- **Decision**: CSV file drives all metadata (slugs, categories, clusters, work dates)
- **Rationale**: Enables manual control, easy bulk editing, clear audit trail
- **Impact**: All automation scripts sync from CSV â†’ JSON â†’ Website
- **Location**: TBD (likely `/data/blog-metadata.csv`)

### **Work Date vs Pub Date**
- **Decision**: Maintain two separate timestamps
- **Rationale**: Story happened out of chronological order (backfilled historical posts)
- **Impact**: Sort/filter by work date for narrative, pub date for insights
- **UI**: Display both with clear labels

### **Category System: Narrative vs Insight**
- **Decision**: Binary classification, not tags
- **Rationale**: Clear mental model, enables distinct navigation paths
- **Impact**: Two browsing modes, different default sorts

### **Narrative Clustering**
- **Decision**: Group narrative posts into named "chapters"
- **Rationale**: Makes 155+ posts navigable, tells story arc
- **Impact**: Timeline view, chapter navigation, cluster landing pages

## ðŸŽ“ Lessons Learned from Phases 1-3

### **What Worked Well**
1. **RSS automation**: Daily updates work reliably
2. **Image pipeline**: 100% coverage achieved systematically
3. **Content cleaning**: Dual-format handling (RSS + export) works great
4. **Caption extraction**: Regex approach works for both formats
5. **Static generation**: 155 dynamic routes with static export = fast + cheap

### **What We'd Do Differently**
1. **Slugs first**: Should have used human-legible slugs from start
2. **CSV earlier**: Would have saved manual post-by-post work
3. **Metadata planning**: Work dates, categories, clusters should have been planned upfront

### **Technical Highlights**
- Zero external dependencies for HTML parsing (pure regex)
- Comprehensive Tailwind prose styling maintains design system
- Smart content cleaning handles multiple Medium formats
- TypeScript throughout with strong domain types

## ðŸ’­ Open Questions for User

### **Phase 4 (Slugs)**
1. Should robo* images have canonical names? If so, what naming convention?
   - Example: `robot-trainer.webp`, `robot-limb.webp`, `robot-ethics.webp`
   - Or standardize to single format: `robo-trainer`, `robo-limb`?

2. For slug generation from "Title: Subtitle" format:
   - Use full title or just first part before colon?
   - Max slug length?
   - How to handle duplicates/collisions?

### **Phase 5 (CSV)**
1. Where should CSV live?
   - `/data/blog-metadata.csv`?
   - Root level?
   - Separate repo?

2. Should CSV be checked into git or stored externally?
   - Pro git: Version history, easy rollback
   - Con git: Manual merge conflicts

### **Phase 10 (Featured Article)**
1. What's your preference for featured article selection?
   - **Option A**: Always most recent
   - **Option B**: Manual selection via CSV flag
   - **Option C**: Hybrid (manual override, default to recent)
