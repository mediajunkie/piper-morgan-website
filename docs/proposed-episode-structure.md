# Phase 8: Proposed Episode Structure

## Methodology Summary

Based on analysis of 156 blog posts, I've identified 12 narrative episodes using the following criteria:

### Episode Boundary Detection
- **Temporal gaps**: 3-6 day breaks in posting activity
- **Boundary markers**: Posts with titles containing "Strategic Pause," "Reckoning," "Reflection," "Convergence," "Breakthrough"
- **Multi-week groupings**: Episodes span multiple weeks, not individual days
- **Thematic coherence**: Posts within episodes share common themes

### Timeline Overview
- **Dated posts**: 94 posts (spanning July 8 - September 21)
- **Undated posts**: 62 posts (foundational/early work)
- **Date clusters**: 27 distinct posting dates
- **Major gaps**: 10 gaps of 3+ days marking episode boundaries

## Next Steps

1. **User Review**: Validate episode groupings and names
2. **Refinement**: Adjust boundaries or themes based on feedback
3. **CSV Population**: Add cluster names to CSV `cluster` column
4. **JSON Update**: Rebuild medium-posts.json with cluster metadata
5. **UI Implementation**: Build cluster navigation and timeline visualization

---

## Questions for Review

1. Do these episode groupings accurately capture the narrative arc of your development journey?
2. Are the episode names clear and evocative of the work in each period?
3. Should any episodes be combined or split?
4. Are there posts in the wrong episode based on your memory of the work?
5. Should Episode 1 (undated posts) be broken into multiple episodes, or kept as one foundational period?
