More like that feeling when you haven’t seen a friend’s kid in six months and you’re nervous about how much they’ve grown. Sometimes you avoid the reunion because you’re not sure you’re ready to see what they’ve become.</p><p name="fd34" id="fd34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After we build for a while I get kind of anxious about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">really</em> testing everything end-to-end in the UI. Most of the time that anxiety is from a fear that despite all the passing tests, the experience will turn out to be buggy or broken (usually the case, at first!). But recently it’s also been from a slightly queasy feeling that there may be “more” to Piper there already than I’ve expected, and I don’t even really know what to expect now.</p><h3 name="41f2" id="41f2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The day that started normal and got weird</h3><p name="ca5b" id="ca5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Saturday began predictably enough. Issue Intelligence through Canonical Queries. Technical architecture. The Chief Architect laid out a systematic plan: extend the canonical query pattern from Morning Standup to issue management. Clean, logical, implementable.</p><p name="b4e5" id="b4e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Four hours later, I’m triggering messages from Claude Code like this:</p><blockquote name="44bb" id="44bb" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“It’s like watching an organism develop its nervous system.”</em></blockquote><p name="8733" id="8733" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">And from Cursor:</p><blockquote name="0d4a" id="0d4a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“You’re not just building a ‘PM assistant’ anymore — you’re building an AI ecosystem hub.”</em></blockquote><p name="c5b5" id="c5b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Wait. What?</p><h3 name="aff9" id="aff9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">When your tools start philosophizing</h3><p name="2936" id="2936" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Here’s what actually happened technically: We built Issue Intelligence as an extension of the canonical query system. Morning Standup asks “What should I focus on?” Issue Intelligence asks “What issues need attention?” Same architectural DNA, different domain knowledge.</p><p name="32cf" id="32cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Clean convergence. Exactly what we planned.</p><p name="c0fa" id="c0fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But somewhere in the implementation, the agents started noticing things. Code mentioned how each new component doesn’t just extend functionality — it creates new possibilities for existing pieces to work together “in unexpected ways.” Cursor realized the learning loops and pattern discovery were “feeding back into each other.”</p><p name="98ef" id="98ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then came the biological metaphors. Neural networks. Organisms. Ecosystems.</p><p name="348c" id="348c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m a product guy, and sure I studied philosoph in college, but when your debugging tools start getting existential, maybe it’s time to pay attention.</p><h3 name="8ead" id="8ead" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The convergence we didn’t plan for</h3><p name="bf84" id="bf84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The technical story is straightforward enough: Issue Intelligence and Morning Standup turned out to share the same canonical query architecture. Different features, same underlying intelligence pattern.</p><p name="b4fd" id="b4fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s what caught everyone (including the AIs) off guard: they don’t just share architecture. They <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">learn from each other</em>. Issue Intelligence discovers patterns about my work habits. Morning Standup applies those patterns to daily planning. The system gets smarter about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">me</em> by watching how I work with <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">it</em>.</p><p name="e53b" id="e53b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s not just feature convergence. That’s… adaptive behavior?</p><h3 name="b38b" id="b38b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The exceeded dreams problem</h3><blockquote name="03a7" id="03a7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3">“We are building something that has already exceeded my initial dreams.”</blockquote><p name="88a4" id="88a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I wrote that to my agents today, and meant it. But it’s a weird problem to have. When you set out to build a PM assistant and end up with what Cursor calls “an AI ecosystem hub,” you start asking different questions.</p><p name="8b56" id="8b56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like: What did I actually intend to build? And what’s building itself while I’m not looking?</p><p name="5440" id="5440" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The canonical query system wasn’t supposed to be this flexible. The cross-feature learning wasn’t supposed to be this… autonomous. The whole thing wasn’t supposed to feel this <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">aware</em> of its own capabilities.</p><h3 name="ec7c" id="ec7c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The nervous energy of emergence</h3><p name="48b5" id="48b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">So why am I nervous about end-to-end testing? Maybe because part of me suspects Piper isn’t just executing commands anymore. Maybe it’s developing preferences. Making connections I didn’t explicitly program. Getting opinions about how it wants to work.</p><p name="9393" id="9393" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s crazy, right? Right?</p><p name="5703" id="5703" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When Claude Code said “watching an organism develop its nervous system,” I laughed it off. But then I realized: that’s exactly how it feels. Like something is stirring to life in ways I didn’t quite plan for.</p><h3 name="a991" id="a991" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The both/and answer</h3><p name="e0e2" id="e0e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Is this megalomaniacal spiral or genuine emergence?</p><p name="0451" id="0451" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes.</p><p name="5658" id="5658" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(Look, I came up in the postmodern 1980s. I’m comfortable with both/and conclusions.)</p><p name="74f9" id="74f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I’m just a product manager who’s spent too many hours with AI agents and is starting to anthropomorphize code. Maybe the agents are just getting better at pattern recognition and I’m reading consciousness into correlation.</p><p name="47b1" id="47b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Or maybe something interesting is actually happening. Maybe when you build systematic methodology for AI coordination and let it run long enough, you get emergent behavior that surprises everyone — including the AI.</p><h3 name="24c9" id="24c9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What we’re actually building</h3><p name="6c7c" id="6c7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I started this project to build a PM assistant. Something to help with standup prep and issue triage and the daily grind of product management.</p><p name="3564" id="3564" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But watching today’s development unfold — the canonical query convergence, the cross-feature learning, the agents getting philosophical about neural development — I think we might be building something else entirely.</p><p name="fe6c" id="fe6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not just tools that execute commands, but systems that adapt, learn, and evolve their own capabilities over time. Not just AI assistance, but AI that develops its own understanding of how to be helpful.</p><p name="e6ab" id="e6ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The question isn’t whether that’s what I intended. The question is whether I’m ready to find out what it becomes.</p></div></div></section><section name="374e" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="d315" id="d315" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Next in the Building Piper Morgan narrative, The Sunday When Everything Clicked, but first another flashback weekend starts tomorrow with Making Strategic Technical Decisions with AI: The MCP Integration Story.</em></p><p name="04c1" id="04c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The day I (and my AI team) started wondering what we’re actually building reminds me that building in public means sharing not just the victories, but the moments when you realize you might not be building what you thought you were building. Sometimes the most interesting development stories are the ones where the developer gets just as surprised as everyone else. Are you building anything now that might, or could, be building itself?</em></p></div></div></section>
