By then, the energy has faded, the details have blurred, and you’re left trying to reconstruct what really happened from commit messages and fading memories.</p><p name="c45f" id="c45f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We accidentally discovered something better: just-in-time retrospectives that capture the real story while the adrenaline is still flowing and the insights are still sharp.</p><h3 name="4f6a" id="4f6a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The archaeological problem</h3><p name="3528" id="3528" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For weeks, I’d been playing content archaeologist, trying to reconstruct compelling narratives from session logs that were sometimes weeks old. The technical details were all there, but the human story — the frustrations, the breakthroughs, the comedy of debugging — had faded.</p><p name="14aa" id="14aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reading through June session logs in July felt like examining fossils. I could see what had happened, but not how it felt to live through it. The authentic voice was there, but muted by time and distance.</p><h3 name="f218" id="f218" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The accidental discovery</h3><p name="8a80" id="8a80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Then came July 12–15: four days of intense development that generated enough session logs to fill a small book. But this time, instead of filing them away for future archaeological work, I started writing about them immediately.</p><p name="4065" id="4065" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Saturday’s PM-011 completion became a blog post I wrote Sunday. Sunday’s test suite recovery became Monday’s entry. Monday’s architectural cleanup was Tuesday’s story. Tuesday’s epic debugging session was Wednesday’s narrative.</p><p name="96f5" id="96f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each time, the translation from session log to blog post happened within 24 hours of the actual work.</p><h3 name="394e" id="394e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What changed when the memories were fresh</h3><p name="eba5" id="eba5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The difference was startling. Instead of reconstructing what happened, I was reflecting on experiences that were still vivid. The session logs weren’t historical documents — they were live-action transcripts of problems being solved in real time.</p><p name="3dc1" id="3dc1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The energy was preserved</strong>: The frustration of fighting async session errors. The satisfaction of fixing a production bug. The comedy of Python environments and Docker containers having opinions about your life choices.</p><p name="5d3a" id="5d3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The details stayed sharp</strong>: Exact error messages, specific conversation moments, the precise sequence of discoveries that led to insights.</p><p name="b95f" id="b95f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The learning was immediate</strong>: I could see patterns and extract lessons while they were still fresh, not months later when they’d become sanitized corporate wisdom.</p><h3 name="73ac" id="73ac" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The technical storytelling revelation</h3><p name="d819" id="d819" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Session logs, it turns out, have natural narrative structures. Every debugging session is a detective story. Every architectural decision is a strategic choice with tradeoffs. Every breakthrough has a moment of recognition.</p><p name="0a17" id="0a17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The July 15 session was perfect example: what started as “why does this test expect 0.7 but get 0.695?” became a 13-hour journey through production bugs, system evolution, and the nature of learning itself.</p><p name="6685" id="6685" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But that story only existed because we documented it as it happened. The session log captured not just what we fixed, but how we felt when we realized the system had outgrown its tests.</p><h3 name="eeda" id="eeda" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The meta-content goldmine</h3><p name="9f2f" id="9f2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Here’s what surprised me most: the process of building became as interesting as what we built. The collaborative problem-solving, the false starts, the moments of insight — these weren’t byproducts of development. They were the main event.</p><p name="9ab1" id="9ab1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since I started sharing these articles, I’ve found that readers don’t just want to know that we achieved 100% repository pattern compliance (whatever that means). They wanted to understand how we discovered the rogue dual implementations, why we investigated instead of patching, and what it felt like to realize we’d been chasing the wrong problem.</p><p name="0590" id="0590" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">People love blooper reels.</p><h3 name="2ea0" id="2ea0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The sustainable content pipeline</h3><p name="4bfd" id="4bfd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">By July 15, a pattern had emerged:</p><p name="245e" id="245e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Step 1</strong>: Development session with detailed logging</p><p name="33cd" id="33cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Step 2</strong>: Just-in-time retrospective while memories are fresh</p><p name="e00e" id="e00e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Step 3</strong>: Blog post draft capturing both technical and human story</p><p name="0f22" id="0f22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Step 4</strong>: Polish and publish with authentic voice intact</p><p name="e5fa" id="e5fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Typically now step 4 is weeks after steps 1 to 3, which happen in the evening of the session or the next day, unless I am unusually busy.</p><p name="6338" id="6338" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This has created a sustainable content pipeline that required no additional research, no archaeological reconstruction, and no struggling to remember what actually happened.</p><h3 name="aba6" id="aba6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The quality difference</h3><p name="de7c" id="de7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Compare these approaches:</p><p name="514d" id="514d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Traditional retrospective</strong> (weeks later): “We improved our repository pattern compliance and fixed some test failures. The team learned about async session management.”</p><p name="9008" id="9008" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Just-in-time retrospective</strong> (24 hours later): “At 6:18 AM, we discovered our filename matching had never worked properly because a regex ignored underscores. For months, I’d been working around this bug without realizing it. One character change fixed a production problem I didn’t even know I had.”</p><p name="3627" id="3627" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One is a summary. The other is a story.</p><h3 name="8270" id="8270" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The broader application</h3><p name="48af" id="48af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This isn’t just about technical content. Any complex work — product decisions, strategic planning, team dynamics — has rich narratives that fade quickly.</p><p name="a737" id="a737" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The key insights:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="91ec" id="91ec" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Capture immediately</strong>: Don’t wait for the “right time” to reflect</li><li name="aa9e" id="aa9e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Document feelings, not just facts</strong>: How decisions felt matters as much as what was decided</li><li name="e70a" id="e70a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Preserve the journey</strong>: The path to solutions is often more valuable than the solutions themselves</li><li name="7a8f" id="7a8f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Show the work</strong>: Authentic process beats polished outcomes</li></ul><h3 name="edf2" id="edf2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">The building-in-public evolution</h3><p name="8857" id="8857" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I started building Piper Morgan in public to share what I was learning with people I respect. There is a there there and I’m kind of finding it and I didn’t want to keep it all to myself. This just-in-time retrospective approach revealed something deeper: the process of building is itself a kind of product.</p><p name="739e" id="739e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, the session logs have also been set aside to become training data for Piper. It’s one thing to review technical specifications, but it’s a whole nother thing to study examples of how an experienced PM thinks through complex problems. The collaborative problem-solving, the strategic tradeoffs, the resistance to quick fixes.</p><h3 name="1da9" id="1da9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A content strategy emerges</h3><p name="8d9c" id="8d9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Traditional content strategies require dedicated resources: research time, writing time, editing time. The just-in-time retrospective approach turns necessary development documentation into content pipeline feedstock.</p><p name="89cf" id="89cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re not adding content work on top of development work. We’re extracting the natural stories that live inside every complex project.</p><p name="2e0e" id="2e0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I do have an editorial calendar though, maintained by me manually with no automation or bots helping (yet).</p><figure name="cd4d" id="cd4d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ucWhUSCaQcX9ddnLytIJ5Q.png" data-width="910" data-height="727" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ucWhUSCaQcX9ddnLytIJ5Q.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">One view of the Building Piper Morgan editorial calendar</figcaption></figure><h3 name="aa65" id="aa65" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">The human element</h3><p name="f9ce" id="f9ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Perhaps most importantly, this approach preserves the human story of building technology. The late-night debugging sessions. The moment when three different AI agents start referring to your system with pronouns because they recognize its intelligence. The satisfaction of choosing investigation over quick fixes.</p><p name="bdd9" id="bdd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These moments don’t survive traditional retrospectives. They’re too personal, too immediate, too specific to make it into quarterly summaries.</p><p name="65d4" id="65d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But they’re exactly what makes technical content compelling and relatable.</p><h3 name="182e" id="182e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The unexpected side effect</h3><p name="2853" id="2853" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The most surprising result? Better development practices. When you know you’ll be writing about your problem-solving process within 24 hours, you become more thoughtful about that process.</p><p name="4c22" id="4c22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You document decisions more carefully. You think more strategically about tradeoffs. You resist quick fixes because you know you’ll have to explain your reasoning while it’s still fresh.</p><p name="8100" id="8100" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Building in public with just-in-time retrospectives doesn’t just create better content. It creates better thinking.</p><h3 name="b037" id="b037" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Looking forward</h3><p name="499e" id="499e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We’re planning to take this further. Periodic sessions where Piper analyzes her own development logs — not just the technical details, but the qualitative insights about product management in practice.</p><p name="14c3" id="14c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine an AI system that learns not just from training data, but from real-time documentation of how experienced practitioners solve complex problems. The just-in-time retrospective becomes the training curriculum.</p><h3 name="5242" id="5242" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The lesson for everyone else</h3><p name="e9b3" id="e9b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You don’t need to be building AI to benefit from this approach. Any complex work generates stories worth telling. The key is capturing them before they fade.</p><p name="2c0c" id="2c0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your next retrospective doesn’t have to be a formal quarterly review. It can be tomorrow’s reflection on today’s work, written while the insights are still sharp and the energy is still there.</p><p name="b698" id="b698" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The best stories aren’t the ones you plan to tell. They’re the ones you live through and capture immediately, before time turns vivid experiences into vague summaries.</p></div></div></section><section name="216d" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="e477" id="e477" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Next in Building Piper Morgan: We’ll jump ahead to July 19 when I wrote up what I was learning in “The Three-AI Orchestra: Lessons from Coordinating Multiple AI agents.”</em></p><p name="710b" id="710b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Like so many things I’ve learned building Piper I feel that this session log → instant retro → blog post model could work with my real human teams to. Has anyone out there tried this? I know some teams keep project blogs on wikis but I suspect they are more terse usually. Anyone out there know?</em></p></div></div></section>
