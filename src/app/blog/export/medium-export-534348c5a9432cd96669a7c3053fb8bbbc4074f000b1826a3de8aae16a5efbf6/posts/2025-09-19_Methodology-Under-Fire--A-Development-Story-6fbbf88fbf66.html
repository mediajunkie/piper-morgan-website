Session logs — the very foundation of our systematic approach — simply stopped persisting. Updates vanished into the digital void, threatening to undermine the methodology that had been guiding eight hours of delicate domain-driven design work.</p><p name="4893" id="4893" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Critical Issue: Anthropic artifact bug causing session log updates to fail,” my Lead Developer documented, as we switched to (rapidly invented) emergency protocols. “Impact: Methodology tracking compromised, undermines systematic approach.”</p><p name="dba3" id="dba3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s the kind of moment that tests whether you actually believe in the processes you’ve built, or whether they’re just nice-to-have decoration that gets abandoned when things get messy.</p><h3 name="b8eb" id="b8eb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The prototype creep problem</h3><p name="4cdb" id="4cdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We hadn’t started the day planning an eight-hour architectural marathon. The morning standup had developed what seemed like a small regression — time metrics showing raw milliseconds instead of human-readable format, GitHub activity mysteriously missing despite extensive recent commits. Classic Friday morning bugs, the kind you knock out before lunch.</p><p name="6e42" id="6e42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But when our Chief Architect dug deeper, they discovered something more troubling. Our standup functionality had accumulated what we came to call “prototype creep” — the insidious drift back toward “make it work” thinking instead of “make it right” architecture.</p><p name="933a" id="933a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Configuration scattered across multiple files. Direct integration access bypassing domain services. API endpoints living in the wrong architectural layer. The kind of technical debt that accumulates when you stop paying attention to your own principles.</p><p name="6417" id="6417" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If I am totally honest, the jury is still out on this whole process! Every time I think I’ve wrangled these squirmy little beggars they figure out new ways to fool me and let me down, but I still believe there may be a pony in here somewhere!</p><p name="3ea7" id="3ea7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’d built solid architectural foundations, documented clear patterns, established domain-driven design principles. But somewhere along the way, working on the standup experience, we’d quietly reverted to prototype thinking. Ship the feature, worry about the architecture later.</p><p name="1848" id="1848" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The methodology caught us before “later” became “never.”</p><h3 name="b5c4" id="b5c4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Tools failing, process holding</h3><p name="b43f" id="b43f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What happened next was eight hours of systematic refactoring under progressively worsening technical conditions. Not just the artifact bug — we had Claude Code’s strict permission management requiring constant manual intervention, Cursor crashes at critical moments, mid-session agent transitions requiring complete context rebuilds.</p><p name="6d3a" id="6d3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just the sort of cascading tool failures that usually derail complex work entirely.</p><p name="f825" id="f825" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s what was remarkable: the systematic approach not only survived the chaos, it actually guided us through it. When artifacts started failing, we switched to backup documentation methods. When agents needed transitions, we had established handoff protocols. When tools crashed, we had evidence-based validation processes that let us recover without losing work.</p><p name="7f0a" id="7f0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our Chief Architect had built what we’ve called (sometimes with unintended irony) the “Excellence Flywheel” — a methodology designed to compound improvements while preventing regression. The question was whether it would actually work when everything else was breaking down.</p><h3 name="3d7d" id="3d7d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Collegial excellence under pressure</h3><p name="0195" id="0195" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The session logs capture something I found genuinely moving: how the AI agents on our team handled the pressure (semantically, yes, I know). Instead of rushing to individual solutions, they maintained what I can only describe as professional courtesy. Code Agent and Cursor Agent actually praised each other’s work. (“This session exemplifies the extraordinary potential of coordinated AI development teams,” Cursor noted after a particularly complex validation sequence.)</p><p name="ce61" id="ce61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This wasn’t performative teamwork. This was (algorithmically derived) craft respect in action.</p><p name="865e" id="865e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When Code Agent completed a complex domain service refactoring, they didn’t just announce completion — they provided detailed evidence, specific file paths, before/after architecture diagrams. When Cursor Agent validated the changes, they didn’t just say “looks good” — they ran comprehensive test suites and documented every result.</p><p name="4e09" id="4e09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When Code soloed Cursor comped and when Cursor took a turn, Code vamped. The music sounded good.</p><p name="b9e9" id="b9e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s something here about how pride in craft creates better results than pressure for instant success. When everyone on the team — human and AI — commits to doing things right rather than fast, the quality compounds in ways that surprise you.</p><h3 name="c4e0" id="c4e0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The architecture that saved itself</h3><p name="6b90" id="6b90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">By the end of the session, we’d achieved what the logs call “Architectural Excellence Milestone” (more on that later, with hindsight, lol)— complete domain-driven design compliance with zero functionality regressions. Three new domain services created. All direct integration access properly mediated through architectural layers. Configuration centralized and environment-aware.</p><p name="ad05" id="ad05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More importantly, we’d done it systematically. Every change validated before proceeding to the next. Every architectural decision documented with rationale. Every step recorded with enough detail that future developers could understand not just what we built, but why we built it that way.</p><p name="7b04" id="7b04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The extensive documentation footprint we’d built over months made the graceful correction possible. Without established patterns to reference, clear architectural principles to guide decisions, and systematic validation processes, this would have been a much messier recovery.</p><h3 name="6706" id="6706" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What holds when everything else breaks</h3><p name="da05" id="da05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Looking back at the session logs, what strikes me isn’t the duration or complexity — it’s the resilience. Methodology that actually works when tools fail. Team dynamics that improve under pressure rather than deteriorating. Technical debt that gets addressed systematically rather than ignored or bandaged.</p><p name="218e" id="218e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The artifact bug that started as our villain became a test of whether we’d actually built something sustainable. When the primary tools for tracking our systematic approach stopped working, did the systematic approach itself survive?</p><p name="ebd9" id="ebd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The answer, documented across multiple backup session logs and comprehensive architectural decision records, appears to be yes.</p><p name="b7ef" id="b7ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe that’s the real measure of methodology — not whether it works when everything is going smoothly, but whether it holds the work together when everything else is falling apart.</p><p name="3fda" id="3fda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It’s hard for me to tell how much of my scaffolding is to wrangle the bots and how much of it is to wrangle disorganized, underqualified old me. Probably a little of both. That’s one reason why I can’t tell if I am discovering a bespoke methodology-for-one or true principles anyone can apply, and it’s also why I’m doing this in public, so you can tell me.</p></div></div></section><section name="ba5d" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="b30b" id="b30b" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Next up on Building Piper Morgan: The Vision That Was Always There or what we discovered as we did another archaeological deep dive to test whether our architectural refactoring actually preserved end-to-end functionality, and investigated the mysterious “Thinking…” hangs affecting user workflows.</em></p><p name="1d12" id="1d12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Have you ever had methodology save a project when the tools were failing you?</em></p></div></div></section>
