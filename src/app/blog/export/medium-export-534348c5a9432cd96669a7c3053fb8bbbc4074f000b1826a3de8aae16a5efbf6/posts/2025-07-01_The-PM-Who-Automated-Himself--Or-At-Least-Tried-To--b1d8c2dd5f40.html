Let’s go back to the beginning:</em></p><p name="bd69" id="bd69" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p"><span class="graf-dropCap">E</span>very product manager has that moment. You’re writing your seventh “As a user, I want to…” story of the day, and your brain just rebels.</p><p name="cb93" id="cb93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mine happened at 9:47 PM on a Tuesday. I was rolling up my sleeves to do the scut work of product management, drafting thorough yet concise and consistent description of tasks as Github issues. I don’t even hate work like this. You can put music on (some music). It reminds me of xeroxing documents in the repo room listening to my walkman back in (ask your parents).</p><p name="4877" id="4877" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s when the dangerous thought crept in: “What if I had a junior PM who could do this for me, or even an intern, an apprentice?” Followed immediately by the more dangerous thought: “What if that junior PM was made of code?”</p><p name="897f" id="897f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">OK, that’s not how it happened at all. Wise friends such as Christina Wodtke had been making the point that today’s LLM-powered AIs behave a bit like eager interns: well trained in the generalities, almost useless when it comes down to domain expertise and nuance and that got me thinking (really) about how great interns are and how helpful they can be just by taking on work you’d like to get done but don’t have the focused time or attention for, and how with real human interns they get better!</p><p name="7a9c" id="7a9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They learn by going to your meetings and taking notes and asking questions, by getting copied on your emails and tracking down facts for you and asking questions, by reading (or “ingesting”?) books you recommend and taking trainings you pay for… and asking questions.</p><p name="b061" id="b061" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I got to really really thinking: What if I could make me one of thems? A persistent assistant or agent (?) that learns about my context and my opinions on product best practices and … wants to be hired after the apprenticeship ends as an associate and … aspires to be a real PM someday?</p><p name="3369" id="3369" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As cool as it would be to have a one-of-those, it also seemed like just trying to make one at all would be a hell of a trip and a learning experience.</p><h3 name="4dbf" id="4dbf" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The vision: a digital product trainee</h3><p name="cf45" id="cf45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Disclaimer: I prefer real human interns! I work with them every chance I get. Still, there are some valuable separations of concerns. We humans are great at some things AIs can’t do and No I’m not going to mention it here while they’re obviously reading too!</p><p name="4168" id="4168" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But seriously, here’s what I was imagining: not some AI that would replace product managers (if only), but something more like a really eager intern who:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="6784" id="6784" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Never forgets the acceptance criteria format</li><li name="96e4" id="96e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Actually reads all the documentation (and remembers it)</li><li name="4bfd" id="4bfd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Can draft routine tickets without complaining</li><li name="05ef" id="05ef" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Learns from corrections without taking it personally</li><li name="8131" id="8131" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is available at 9:47 PM on a Tuesday</li></ul><p name="3090" id="3090" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">I called it P-M and then I had to set up a github repository and for some reason the codename piper-morgan occured to me and thus Piper Morgan was born, or at least christened. Plus, every good product needs a name before it has features. We’ve even got a logo already!</p><h3 name="33cb" id="33cb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why build instead of buy?</h3><p name="dc48" id="dc48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Look, there are AI writing tools out there. Lots of them. But here’s the thing about generic AI tools and product management: it’s like using a Swiss Army knife to perform surgery. Technically possible? Maybe. Good idea? Eh. Also, the persistence is basically nil. You are starting over with amnesia all the time. I knew I had to build on existing tools (I’m not training my own LLM for gosh sake!). But I also knew none of the existing tools are offering what I need out of the box (sidenote, persistent projects in Claude are getting me partway there and helping me tread some cowpaths I may later pave in Piper).</p><p name="c7c2" id="c7c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I needed wasn’t just something that could write. I needed something that could:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="e715" id="e715" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Understand the difference between a bug and a feature request</li><li name="1f3a" id="1f3a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Know when something needs acceptance criteria vs. just a description</li><li name="8cc1" id="8cc1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Pull context from our actual documentation (not just vibes)</li><li name="6496" id="6496" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Format things the way <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">we</em> format them, not some generic template</li></ul><p name="966d" id="966d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Plus, let’s be honest: I wanted to understand how these LLM things actually worked. Nothing teaches you like building. I’m a project-based learner. Well a conversational learner when it comes to ideas, but project-based if I’m to learn how to do a thing. It can’t be “Hello, world!” either. It has to be something I really want that I can’t get without learning how to do the thing.</p><h3 name="a2cb" id="a2cb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The first sketch: conversational from day one</h3><p name="2d4d" id="2d4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The initial design was ambitious in its simplicity. Instead of building yet another form-based ticket creator, I wanted something conversational. Something that felt more like pair programming with a junior colleague than filling out a template.</p><pre data-code-block-mode="1" spellcheck="false" data-code-block-lang="vbnet" name="2bb2" id="2bb2" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p graf--preV2"><span class="pre--content"><span class="hljs-symbol">Me:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;We need login functionality&quot;</span><br /><span class="hljs-symbol">Piper:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;I&#x27;ll help create an issue for that. What type of authentication - email/password, SSO, or both?&quot;</span><br /><span class="hljs-symbol">Me:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Both, plus social login&quot;</span><br /><span class="hljs-symbol">Piper:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Got it. Should this support MFA as well?&quot;</span></span></pre><p name="1aab" id="1aab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">That alone would make some of the tedious work easier. And yes, a copilot tool in a programming IDE or github can already do a lot of this in a fragmented way (write a ticket, follow a template, do genericky product stuff), just as engineers already have these ways to write code more efficiently and designers — reluctant as many are for all the right reasons — are seeing rapid-prototyping features crop up in Figma et al.</p><p name="43c3" id="43c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Product folks are still wondering for the most part how we are supposed to partake of these new efficiencies.</p><h3 name="c27b" id="c27b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Which dots to connect</h3><p name="411a" id="411a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I knew I wasn’t making an LLM. I’m making something that uses LLMs to do its thing. I needed to call out to one or more platforms with developer API keys. (I had already set one up to play with an earlier experiment wth OpenAI.)</p><p name="2b4d" id="2b4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The landscape in early June of 2025 looked something like:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="f7b2" id="f7b2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">OpenAI (ChatGPT)</strong>: The obvious choice, great marketing, everyone using it</li><li name="a2c2" id="a2c2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Hugging Face</strong>: Open source appeal, but need your own hardware</li><li name="4ca1" id="4ca1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Anthropic Claude</strong>: The dark horse, claiming better reasoning</li><li name="7617" id="7617" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Others</strong>: Various alternatives I won’t name to avoid dating this post</li></ul><p name="b73a" id="b73a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">My AI imagines that I “spent a weekend reading documentation, comparing APIs, and doing what product managers do best: making a comparison matrix that I’d eventually ignore in favor of gut instinct” according to an earlier draft of this post, but that’s pure fabrication.</p><p name="91c1" id="91c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth is I really didn’t care yet which tool I used as long as it proved the concept. I had an OpenAI key already and my boss, who is wise in the way of these things, later suggested I lean toward Anthropic but to me they’re all black boxes, services that my thing will use to drive its own engine. Whatever works for now is fine, just don’t lock me in.</p><h3 name="9fc7" id="9fc7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The architecture bet that paid off</h3><p name="e80c" id="e80c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Here’s where I made what turned out to be the smartest decision of the whole project: I built it vendor-agnostic from day one.</p><p name="b261" id="b261" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of coding directly against OpenAI’s API, I created what I called an “LLM Adapter” — basically a translation layer that could talk to any AI provider. Seemed like overengineering at the time. My inner YAGNI voice was screaming.</p><pre data-code-block-mode="1" spellcheck="false" data-code-block-lang="rust" name="40aa" id="40aa" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p graf--preV2"><span class="pre--content">class LLMAdapter:<br />    def __init__(<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>, provider: <span class="hljs-type">str</span>)  # <span class="hljs-symbol">&#x27;claude</span>&#x27; or <span class="hljs-symbol">&#x27;openai</span>&#x27; or <span class="hljs-symbol">&#x27;whatever</span>&#x27;<br />    def <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">generate_response</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>, prompt: <span class="hljs-type">str</span>, context: List[<span class="hljs-type">str</span>]) <span class="hljs-punctuation">-&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-type">str</span><br />    def <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">switch_provider</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>, new_provider: <span class="hljs-type">str</span>) <span class="hljs-punctuation">-&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-literal">None</span></span></pre><p name="9d12" id="9d12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">Spoiler alert: When I hit a rate limit during testing I was able to gracefully switching providers a few weeks later and keep testing. That “overengineering” saved my bacon.</p><h3 name="5e6a" id="5e6a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The proof of life moment</h3><p name="9f61" id="9f61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The first version was embarrassingly simple but it already “did something”:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="b4c3" id="b4c3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Some synthetic product documents (made-up requirements docs)</li><li name="f2fc" id="f2fc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Basic question-answering using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)</li><li name="2ba0" id="2ba0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A command-line interface that would make a 1980s hacker proud</li></ul><p name="cb3e" id="cb3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">But then I asked it: “What are the requirements for user authentication?”</p><p name="b0c4" id="b0c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And it answered.
