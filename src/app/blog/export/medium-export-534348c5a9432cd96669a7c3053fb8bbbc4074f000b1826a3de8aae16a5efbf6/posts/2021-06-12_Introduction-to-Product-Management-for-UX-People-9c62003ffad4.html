How do product and UX relate to each other, how do they work well together, what is the “correct” relationship between product and UX?</p><p name="c951" id="c951" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It depends.</p><p name="dab7" id="dab7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">OK, with that out of the way, from here on in I’ll cite about specific examples (thinly disguised if need be, or generalized if it’s a ubiquitous pattern) from so that you can plot your own mental model for where product fits into the UX world view (and vice versa).</p><p name="d346" id="d346" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s start by rewinding a bunch of years…</p><h3 name="2004" id="2004" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Ten Years Ago I Took This Workshop…</h3><p name="5104" id="5104" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A little over ten years ago I was a staff interaction designer at Yahoo and curator of the legendary design pattern library there (my business card read “Pattern Detective.” My boss at the time was a senior director of UED (user experience design) on the platform design team, Erin Malone, with whom I later co-authored a book on social experience design.</p><p name="0f02" id="0f02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We were both presenting at the Information Architecture Summit that year and when we saw there was a workshop about product management for user experience designers (being taught by Jeff Lash and Chris Baum), we both jumped at the chance to sign up, I suspect for similar reasons.</p><p name="b1e2" id="b1e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, at Yahoo, UED reported into something called “the Product org.” All the technical work at the company (putting aside critical but less directly software-related roles in sales, HR, operations, and so on) was delivered in a collaboration between the Product org and the Engineering org. These two behemoths were locked in an endless battle for ascendancy that happened at all levels, up and down the line, across the company.</p><p name="ae24" id="ae24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our platform design team was actually in the Tech org, but even there UED had to work with and accommodate the demands of product management. (In fact, I was vetoed for the first job Erin recruited me to take on, on her team, by a product manager who worried I was “too senior” and wouldn’t be satisfied just cranking out mocks based on his wireframes.)</p><p name="248a" id="248a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But more importantly, Yahoo as a whole treated user experience design (and research) as an arm of product. This was all new to me. I had cut my teeth first in the independent, art-oriented web of the 90s and then building websites for clients in freelance, agency, and consulting contexts. These sites were not product. They sold products, or advertised them, or promoted them. A big part of the appeal of Yahoo was getting closer to making functional experiences for people to engage with, and getting out the business of building microsites and revamping home pages and site navigation for various brick-and-mortar businesses.</p><p name="944a" id="944a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So this ideas that were were making a product, and that product people governed our work, made a big impression on me, and Jeff and Chris’s workshop provided a great opportunity to learn more about the habits and drives of product people. It also left me with the seed of a new passion.</p><h3 name="013d" id="013d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">If You Can’t Beat ’Em…</h3><p name="384b" id="384b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Another moment that made a huge impression on me was the day Larry Cornett went from being the VP of User Experience Design for the Yahoo Search product to being the VP of Product for that same team.</p><p name="8b3b" id="8b3b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You can do that!?” I realized.</p><p name="2efc" id="2efc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was a few more years before I followed them over to what a lot of UX designers still to this day refer to as “the dark side.”</p><p name="39b9" id="39b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Did I become one of the oppressors? Do you have to switch teams to get ahead or to influence product strategy? Or can product and UX join forces as “super friends”?
