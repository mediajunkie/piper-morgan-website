We kicked around several ideas I was considering to address the growing demand for product management wisdom and she said to me “You should write about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">product people</em>.”</p><p name="01d1" id="01d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She noted that suddenly everyone is thinking in terms of products. Everyone is aware their product isn’t great, or they have no product strategy, or they’re not even sure if they have achieved product-market fit. But lots of people still aren’t sure what is really meant by a product in the digital age of software as a service in the cloud, and while lots of folks  are happy to tell you that what you really need is to find and hire more product people, this only leads to more questions: What are product people? Where do they come from? How are they made? Where do you find them? and What exactly do they do?</p><p name="a27c" id="a27c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most of my consulting work over the past several years boils down to helping business leaders understand the role of product and the benefits of cultivating a product mindset on their digital teams. We work on product strategy, product operations, planning and shipping cadences, discovery and execution, organization design, and recruiting and hiring. </p><p name="f4af" id="f4af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Christina suggested I reach out to our mutual friend, Jeff Gothelf, telling me about Sense &amp; Respond, the press he had founded with his co-author Josh Seiden, and I was delighted when they agreed to publish this book.</p><p name="4316" id="4316" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Beyond Christina, without whom this book would not exist, I’d also like to acknowledge the other folks who have coached and mentored me in the art and craft of product, most notably Jay Zaveri, Rich Mironov, Ha Phan, Matte Scheinker.</p><p name="4098" id="4098" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d also like to acknowledge Sam Zimmerman, Ranna Zhou, Spectra Asala, Greg Nadeau, Ramesh Raskar, Adam Berrey, Kyle Towle, A.J. Pape, Rob Brink, Vince Muñoz, and many other wonderful folks I had the privilege of working with at the PathCheck Foundation for dedicating so many hours and so much energy to pandemic relief, and providing me with an amazing laboratory environment in which to see a product organization standing itself up.</p><p name="8c82" id="8c82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d like to acknowledge all the people who’ve used products I shipped, especially the millions of people who’ve participated in compassionate caring conversations via 7cups.com and the people of California for whom I had the privilege of product managing covid19.ca.gov for the better part of two years, all of whom have taught me more than anyone about the meaning and purpose of product work.</p><p name="05af" id="05af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, I’d like to acknowledge the infinite patience and forbearance of my beloved soulmate, Briggs Nisbet, who manages to accommodate me every time I go through the inevitable insanity that somehow always accompanies the writing of a book.</p><p name="dc9e" id="dc9e" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
