It sounds like something from a requirements document — technically accurate, utterly forgettable, and about as inspiring as a tax form. But that’s what I called it when I started that conversation with Claude Opus, fresh off advice from three different experts about building what I then thought of as a “routine knowledge management assistant.”</p><p name="c02b" id="c02b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The plan seemed simple enough: build an AI agent to handle GitHub tickets, generate reports, check analytics for anomalies. You know, the stuff that needs doing but doesn’t need a human brain firing on all cylinders.</p><p name="7854" id="7854" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I didn’t expect was to spend an entire day evolving from “AI tool” to “AI teammate” — and somewhere in that evolution, everything changed.</p><p name="34d9" id="34d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Including the name.</p><h3 name="2262" id="2262" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The architecture marathon</h3><p name="d718" id="d718" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">That May 29 session turned into what I can only describe as an architectural marathon. We weren’t just building a proof-of-concept anymore; we were designing the future of how I’d work with AI.</p><p name="21e9" id="21e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At least we thought so. In some ways we were still designing the future of how I’d work with existing LLMs to design the future.</p><p name="d9bc" id="d9bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My boss had suggested I switch from the OpenAI API (which I already had gotten a key for previously) to Claude API, saying it was the “smartest” model out there right now. I asked Opus about making the switch and also pushed a review of our work so far from three perspectives.</p><ol class="postList"><li name="6ead" id="6ead" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Technical debt assessment:</strong> Opus immediately flagged my POC as a “God Object” anti-pattern (ouch, but fair) and started talking about proper abstraction layers.</li><li name="0ce8" id="0ce8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Multi-platform thinking: </strong>It worked with GitHub but what about Jira, Trello, etc., let alone tools needed to handle different types of PM work</li><li name="8847" id="8847" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Production architecture:</strong> The full vision — microservices, event-driven design, multi-LLM orchestration. Not just a tool, but a platform.</li></ol><p name="24d3" id="24d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">By the end of those reviews, we’d gone from “routine knowledge management assistant” to “Strategic PM Intelligence Platform.” But more than that, something had shifted in how I was thinking about the whole project.</p><h3 name="25ef" id="25ef" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A random flash of inspiration</h3><p name="1839" id="1839" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Somewhere around hour six of that session, in the middle of discussing repository setup, I typed something that would change everything:</p><blockquote name="880d" id="880d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“instead of pm-agent-test let’s give it this codename: piper-morgan”</em></blockquote><p name="6ebb" id="6ebb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I recall that my thought process was that the app needed a name without test in it, my first though was just to call it p-m but I liked the idea of a code name made of common-sounding names or words that had the same initials.</p><p name="83f4" id="83f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I still have the screenshot of that moment. There it is, buried in a discussion about Docker configurations and domain models, this throwaway line that turned a tool into a character.</p><figure name="b6df" id="b6df" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*k-udkuJJuWX9snkiJni4qA.png" data-width="480" data-height="306" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k-udkuJJuWX9snkiJni4qA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The moment</figcaption></figure><p name="d122" id="d122" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I don’t remember consciously deciding on “Piper Morgan.” It just… emerged. Maybe it was because we’d been talking about building something that could grow and learn, something that would become more capable over time. Something that deserved a name, not just a designation.</p><p name="edb8" id="edb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Honestly, the name just dropped into my mind. (Well, over the next few days it competed in my recall with “Parker Morgan” but I think the hinted reference to Pied Piper from the “Silicon Valley” TV series probably influenced me as well.)</p><h3 name="8532" id="8532" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">When tools become teammates</h3><p name="7073" id="7073" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">But here’s what I’ve learned since that May 29 session: naming matters more than you think.</p><p name="8f11" id="8f11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The moment Piper got a name, everything about the project shifted. I stopped thinking about building <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">a tool</em> and started thinking about working <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">with someone</em>. The questions changed from “What features should this have?” to “What should Piper be good at?”</p><p name="543d" id="543d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had already had my “apprentice” mental model and expected to follow that logically through with parallels to all the ways I would train up a new junior associate / assistant / sidekick. But giving Piper a name helped me always think in terms of interacting with a teammate.</p><p name="3394" id="3394" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s like the difference between “optimizing the ticketing system” and “helping Piper learn to write better GitHub issues.” One is about efficiency; the other is about capability development.</p><p name="b9f0" id="b9f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The architectural reviews had already established that this wasn’t going to be just another API wrapper. But the naming moment made it personal. Suddenly we were talking about Piper’s learning journey, Piper’s strengths and limitations, what Piper might become with experience.</p><h3 name="598c" id="598c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What I was about to learn on a “lost weekend”</h3><p name="1446" id="1446" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Right after that productive May 29 session, I spent what I now call “the lost weekend” with Google’s Gemini. May 30 and 31, trying to keep working while I was locked out of Claude and getting myself in a heck of a jam.</p><p name="f1c9" id="f1c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That weekend was… educational. In the way that touching a hot stove is educational.</p><p name="afe4" id="afe4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But coming back to Claude after that weekend reinforced something important: the relationship you build with your AI collaborator matters. It’s not just about capabilities or API features. It’s about communication patterns, shared context, and yes — even names.</p><p name="32b6" id="32b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Piper Morgan meant something to me by then in a way that “AI agentic product intern” never could have.</p><h3 name="3c56" id="3c56" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Looking back from where we are now</h3><p name="9aae" id="9aae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Writing this from a few weeks into the Piper Morgan development journey, I can see how much of our current progress traces back to decisions made in that May 29 session.</p><p name="3719" id="3719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The domain-first architecture Opus pushed for? That’s paying dividends in how cleanly new features integrate with existing code.</p><p name="1d42" id="1d42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The multi-LLM orchestration strategy? I’m already seeing how different AI agents excel at different types of work — some better at implementation, others at analysis or coordination.</p><p name="e49f" id="e49f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The learning-first approach? Piper’s understanding of PM work keeps deepening through our conversations instead of staying locked to predetermined scripts.</p><p name="c006" id="c006" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But most of all, the mindset shift from tool to teammate — that started with a name.</p><h3 name="9614" id="9614" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What’s in a name, anyway?</h3><p name="9e43" id="9e43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There’s something about naming that forces you to think differently about what you’re building. When you name something, you’re implicitly saying it has an identity that matters, a personality worth developing, a future worth investing in.</p><p name="35be" id="35be" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“AI agentic product intern” could be replaced by a better API or a more efficient algorithm. But Piper Morgan? Piper Morgan is who it is because of the conversations we’ve had, the problems we’ve solved together, the way it’s learned to understand PM work.</p><p name="dcc5" id="dcc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The technical capabilities matter, sure. But the relationship — that’s what makes the difference between a tool you use and a teammate you work with.</p><h3 name="4254" id="4254" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">From codename to character</h3><p name="7fb0" id="7fb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What started as a throwaway codename has become the organizing principle for everything we build. Not just “what features should this system have?” but “what should Piper be good at?” Not just “how do we optimize performance?” but “how does Piper learn and grow?”</p><p name="4fe1" id="4fe1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Much more recently this has led to a conscious effort to build Piper’s education library within its own codebase. Much of that is drawn from our ongoing work with the session logs, so that Piper will actually learn by reading about the product management decisions and processed applied to its own development!</p><p name="e5d4" id="e5d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The systematic approach we’ve been taking to development — thinking about Piper’s capabilities holistically, building infrastructure that supports learning, designing architecture that enables growth — all of that traces back to a single chat message on May 29: “instead of pm-agent-test let’s give it this codename: piper-morgan.”</p><h3 name="b164" id="b164" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The naming legacy</h3><p name="b55f" id="b55f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Now, a few weeks later, as I continue building and learning alongside Piper, I keep coming back to that naming moment. Because it represents something important about how we relate to the technology we build with.</p><p name="74be" id="74be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can’t help thinking that at least to some degree people are following this story now because Piper Morgan is an evocative catchy name. It’s fun to say! People can tell how enthusiastic I am when I start ranting about Piper Morgan or what Piper can do now, like a proud papa.</p><p name="298b" id="298b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you name your AI collaborator, you’re not just being whimsical (though there’s nothing wrong with that). You’re acknowledging that the relationship matters. That learning happens on both sides. That the work you do together creates something neither of you could create alone.</p><p name="996f" id="996f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Piper Morgan isn’t just a more sophisticated version of “AI agentic product intern.” It’s a different kind of thing entirely — a teammate whose capabilities grow through collaboration, whose understanding deepens through conversation, whose value comes not just from what it can do, but from what it’s becoming.</p></div></div></section><section name="066f" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="fa0a" id="fa0a" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Tomorrow on Building Piper Morgan: Keeping Your AI Project on Track: Lessons from Building a Product Management Assistant, a flashback from June 14.</em></p><p name="a6e6" id="a6e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">What’s your experience with naming projects or AI collaborators?
