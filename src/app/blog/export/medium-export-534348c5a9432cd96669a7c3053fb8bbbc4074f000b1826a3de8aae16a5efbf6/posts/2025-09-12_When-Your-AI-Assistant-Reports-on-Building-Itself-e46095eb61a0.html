Pretty normal for a product manager’s morning routine, except for one detail: those 10 commits included the very work we’d done to fix the standup system itself.</p><p name="fe6a" id="fe6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Piper Morgan was reporting on its own development.</p><p name="0a10" id="0a10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the kind of bootstrap moment that makes you pause and think “OK, we might actually be onto something here.”</p><h3 name="c32a" id="c32a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The last mile</h3><p name="d319" id="d319" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Let me back up. Yesterday morning, our Morning Standup feature was what you might generously call “architecturally complete.” It ran without crashing, displayed beautiful formatted output, and returned mostly null content in under 2 seconds. All the integrations were there in theory — GitHub activity detection, calendar integration, issue intelligence, document memory — but they weren’t actually connected to real data.</p><p name="e36e" id="e36e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What followed was one of those development sessions that reminds you why systematic methodology matters. Instead of diving straight into “let’s fix everything,” we spent 30 minutes just investigating what was actually broken versus what we assumed was broken.</p><p name="8ed6" id="8ed6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Turns out the system wasn’t missing architecture — it was missing specific integrations. GitHub wasn’t detecting recent commits (despite there being plenty). Calendar integration was missing OAuth libraries. Issue Intelligence existed but wasn’t wired to the standup workflow. Document Memory was working fine but only had 8 documents indexed.</p><h3 name="f091" id="f091" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Multi-agent coordination in practice</h3><p name="30f9" id="30f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Here’s where it gets interesting from a process perspective. Rather than tackle this solo, we deployed both Code and Cursor agents in parallel through five systematic phases:</p><p name="023f" id="023f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Phase 0</strong>: Investigation without assumptions (30 minutes)</p><p name="b76a" id="b76a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Phase 1</strong>: Test coverage analysis and infrastructure (20 minutes)</p><p name="90ea" id="90ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Phase 2</strong>: Architecture mapping and configuration analysis (20 minutes)</p><p name="2c50" id="2c50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Phase 3</strong>: Actual repair implementation (40 minutes)</p><p name="c34f" id="c34f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Phase 4</strong>: End-to-end verification (20 minutes)</p><p name="e2f8" id="e2f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Code handled discovery and architecture mapping. Cursor handled implementation and testing. Both agents cross-validated each other’s work. The whole thing took about 9 hours start to finish, but that included OAuth setup, library installation, and comprehensive testing.</p><p name="aa49" id="aa49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most importantly, we captured 18 methodology observations along the way — things like “graceful degradation is not the same as functional success” and “completion excitement versus process discipline.” These observations get fed back into our development framework immediately.</p><h3 name="37de" id="37de" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The bootstrap threshold</h3><p name="ac86" id="ac86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When the final tests passed and I ran that morning standup command, something had shifted. This wasn’t just a successful debugging session — it was Piper Morgan crossing a threshold from “interesting experiment” to “actually useful tool.”</p><p name="325b" id="325b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The system now pulls real data from my configured GitHub repos, my Google Calendar, my document repository, and our issue tracking system. It synthesizes that into a coherent daily briefing in under 6 seconds. And yes, today it reported that recent work included “Morning Standup CLI Investigation &amp; Repair” alongside other project activities.</p><p name="644d" id="644d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This feels like the third or fourth time I’ve had this “crossing the threshold” sensation with Piper Morgan. The first was when the POC could write and critique GitHub issues with real context. Another was when the GUI worked and basic canonical queries felt genuinely useful rather than mock-ups. A third was posting our Weekly Ship and ADR database to my company’s Notion — that felt about as real as it gets.</p><p name="2a84" id="2a84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each time, there’s this moment where you realize the tool has become genuinely useful rather than just technically impressive.</p><h3 name="cf67" id="cf67" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Methodology as product feature</h3><p name="1683" id="1683" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What strikes me about today’s session isn’t just the technical achievement — it’s how the systematic methodology prevented us from going down false paths. By investing in that 30-minute investigation phase, we avoided rebuilding architecture that was already solid and focused repair efforts on specific integration points.</p><p name="9eb9" id="9eb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is “showing your work” in practice. Rather than charging ahead based on assumptions, we mapped the actual problem space first. Rather than claiming success when systems degraded gracefully, we insisted on functional verification. Rather than skipping process steps due to completion excitement, we maintained discipline through final documentation.</p><p name="5387" id="5387" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The methodology observations we captured aren’t just process notes — they’re product intelligence that makes the next development cycle smoother.</p><h3 name="3cd3" id="3cd3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What’s next</h3><p name="77b3" id="77b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The Morning Standup working reliably opens up some interesting questions about development priorities. Do we polish this workflow further, or move on to the next capability? How do we balance “good enough to ship” against “could be even better”?</p><p name="8f4c" id="8f4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a PM principle about knowing when to take the punchbowl away — recognizing when an MVP is functional enough to ship and learn from, rather than continuing to polish in isolation. We might be approaching one of those decision points.</p><p name="3226" id="3226" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">For now, though, I’m enjoying the recursive satisfaction of having Piper Morgan report on its own progress. It’s a small thing, but it signals something larger about the project reaching genuine utility.</p></div></div></section><section name="87da" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="4314" id="4314" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Next on the Building Piper Morgan narrative: When Methodology Meets Reality: Building While Learning but first it’s time for another flashback weekend to talk about process, starting with “The Archaeology of Code or How Session Logs Became Stories” from July 7.</em></p><p name="1b82" id="1b82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Have you ever had that moment where a tool you were building suddenly became useful enough to use for its own development?</em></p></div></div></section>
