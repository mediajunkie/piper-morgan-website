Fostering a Product Culture</h3><h4 name="b2ee" id="b2ee" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle">How do you create a culture that fosters and grows product people? Who are the product people you’ve already got (regardless of title)? Which of your talent can become product people? How do you hire and build a product team?</h4><p name="ede1" id="ede1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">By this time I expect that you have a pretty good feel for what product mindset can do for your business. Cultivating such people so they thrive requires that you invest in a product culture  that nurtures and empowers them. So how do you build a product organization, and where do you find these product people?</p><h3 name="954f" id="954f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--h3-em">Building a product organization</em></h3><p name="8f76" id="8f76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Creating a real product organization starts with a commitment from the top, from you. Change is never easy and new habits cause friction when they clash with comforting older customs. Your executive championship of the product mindset will be a necessary, but not sufficient, ingredient in transforming your business and empowering your product people.</p><p name="7f21" id="7f21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Next, you’re going to need to do the equivalent of a “build vs. buy” analysis that will depend a lot on your current situation.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="dd8b" id="dd8b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Do you have a product org already, but is it what Marty Cagan calls a “<a href="https://svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/" data-href="https://svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">feature factory</a>” stuck in what Melissa Perri called “<a href="https://melissaperri.com/book" data-href="https://melissaperri.com/book" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the build trap</a>”? </li><li name="0b07" id="0b07" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Do you ship software using agile methods with a lot of people called product owners or product managers but no coherent product strategy or roadmap?</li></ul><p name="37ad" id="37ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">If either of the above are true, then you’ll need to bring in new product leadership who will then empower the existing team or make staffing adjustments over time to enable this.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="5632" id="5632" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Do you build software currently without using a product model and without product roles on your teams?</li><li name="e742" id="e742" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Are you on the verge of making your first product hire?</li><li name="a74d" id="a74d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Have you hired a head of product who has been unable to build a product practice and execute?</li></ul><p name="5680" id="5680" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">In these scenarios, you still have the opportunity to build a product org from scratch. The next step is to determine whether you’ve already got talent on staff prepared to take on product responsibilities, either by bringing a product mindset to their existing role or by shifting formally into a product management job.</p><h3 name="a222" id="a222" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--h3-em">Investing in your team</em></h3><p name="bb9f" id="bb9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">To begin with, you need to invest in product <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">craft</em>. Product people need to master these skills and techniques discussed throughout this book, and you need to help them do that. If you have senior product leadership in place (more on that in a moment) then it will be their responsibility to put in place the educational opportunities and events, the training programs, and to build an operation that provides career growth and professional development for product practitioners.</p><blockquote name="2bab" id="2bab" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Product training should be offered to any practitioner who is interested, not just to people with product manager job titles. The goal is to nurture and validate product mindset in any role, across the entire organization.</em></blockquote><figure name="80f5" id="80f5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*bGULHUE6tCe2DMlUMRKZfg.jpeg" data-width="1750" data-height="579" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bGULHUE6tCe2DMlUMRKZfg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://medium.com/atlassian-product-management-blog/atlassian-product-craft-conference-3-reasons-why-149da28a6078" data-href="https://medium.com/atlassian-product-management-blog/atlassian-product-craft-conference-3-reasons-why-149da28a6078" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" target="_blank">Atlassian puts on an internal product craft conference</a> annually to train product people and build the product practice community across the company.</figcaption></figure><p name="41a5" id="41a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">If you do not yet have senior product leadership doing this, then the responsibility will fall to you until that role is filled. (It may make sense to work with a product consultant or a temporary head of product to jumpstart this process.)</p><p name="6e55" id="6e55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A reliable way to broaden and strengthen product skills across your org is through cross-training. This depends on having at least one person who has mastered the skill that others are hoping to develop. Let’s take for example, tracking product analytical data, such as retention, and working systematically to improve it. </p><p name="c082" id="c082" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is an activity that involves a handful of techniques and skills that can be learned, among them:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="154b" id="154b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">capturing valid meaningful data</li><li name="5048" id="5048" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">manipulating charts and graphs to analyze the data</li><li name="eaa6" id="eaa6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">engaging in discovery to understand what is going with customers that might explain the data</li><li name="2ee7" id="2ee7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">developing hypotheses about what might improve the experience</li><li name="138a" id="138a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">prioritizing experiments to test these hypotheses</li><li name="ef19" id="ef19" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">learning from the outcomes of experiments and feeding this learning back into the discovery process</li></ul><p name="8795" id="8795" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The best way to cross-train a product person who is more junior or who has less experience with these activities is to pair them with a senior product person who excels at these things. The key part is that the person who is learning does the work. The person who has the wisdom and experience provides coaching, guidance, and feedback. </p><p name="1a21" id="1a21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the short term, these tasks will take a bit longer than if they were assigned to the experienced hand, but the benefit to distributing this expertise more widely on the team outweighs this cost, and the more cross-training goes on, the more supple and agile the product team will be, more able to flex, recombine, and adapt to handle changing circumstances.</p><h3 name="7096" id="7096" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--h3-em">Enabling transitions</em></h3><p name="b4d1" id="b4d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When you are growing a product team out of the “soil” of your existing staff, you will want to identify people who show the sort of aptitude and instincts discussed throughout this book. They may be engineers, designers, marketers, business analysts, project managers, sales people, customer support staff, or really anything. </p><p name="9124" id="9124" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Make it clear that you are building a product practice and that it will involve some hiring and that people in other roles will be involved as the entire enterprise takes on the habits of a product organization, but that you also welcome people formally transitioning into product management roles, and will facilitate this by providing training, coaching, and mentorship.</p><h3 name="6488" id="6488" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Hiring product people</h3><p name="de5f" id="de5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When a business that has never had product managers before is on the verge of hiring their first product manager (or head of product), there can be a lot of confusion about where to start, what level of talent to bring on first, and how to start incorporating product management into existing processes.</p><p name="2331" id="2331" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are two main variants of this junction in a company’s life:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="b1d4" id="b1d4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">An established business that has been making and shipping software for years now and has not until now seen any need for or benefit from including product managers in the software development process.</li><li name="6b21" id="6b21" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">An early stage startup that consists primarily of one or two founders, a roomful of software engineers (possibly off-shore), and perhaps a handful of other operational roles.</li></ol><p name="f279" id="f279" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The first scenario depends upon organizational change, and while it can be kindled at first with mid-level or junior product managers, the building of a truly empowered product organization won’t really get going without senior product leadership (either on staff or consulting).</p><p name="4c94" id="4c94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For a startup, this can be an anxiety-filled junction, when the time comes to hire a first product person. The vast majority of my own consulting engagements these days are with startups that are literally trying to work out just exactly what product even is, when they need to hire their first product person, what level that person ought to be, and how to find them.</p><p name="e559" id="e559" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth is that in the early stages of a new startup, the founders need to “own” the product. I’d be somewhat suspicious of a founder who planned to outsource the core product work when getting a new business off the ground. But the time always comes when the CEO or operational founder has their hands full with too many things (hiring, dealing with investors or a board, sales, people operations, and so on) and need the leverage that only a dedicated product person can provide.</p><p name="06d1" id="06d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is like a young parent getting a babysitter for the first time: terrifying. It only works if there is deep trust, understanding, and simpatico. A CEO who is lying awake worrying that their new head of product “doesn’t really get it” or might not be paying attention to the right things is getting less than no benefit from having delegated that work. What she needs is someone she fully believes does “get it,” is executing the agreed upon product strategy, and knows when to escalate tricky matters to the boss so that there are never any unpleasant surprises.</p><p name="1983" id="1983" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Product people are well aware of how challenging this first hire can be. Just the other day an entrepreneur I worked with years ago at Yahoo, Greg Cohn, joked to me that “everybody knows you want to be the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">second</em> product hire.” And I knew just what he meant. There seem to be no end to businesses looking for an interim VP of Product to help from manage the transition period after the first candidate hired as a product head has washed out.</p><h3 name="7af9" id="7af9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">How senior the first product hire?</h3><p name="be3b" id="be3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Another tricky aspect of the first product hire is determining the level of experience needed. In early stage startups it’s dangerous to make things too top-heavy, so it’s not uncommon to start with a junior or intermediate level product manager to help more with coordination and alignment and less with strategy and practice building. This can be a good way for the company to start learning product habits and sketching out operational processes that will be formalized over time as the teams evolve.</p><p name="8b9b" id="8b9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In more mature organizations, it’s critical to bring in senior product leadership. Titles vary, but tend to be one of the following</p><ul class="postList"><li name="b873" id="b873" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">head of product — typically used by companies trying to keep things ambiguous and flexible in terms of level</li><li name="affb" id="affb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">director or senior director of product — tends to be a middle manager</li><li name="3daa" id="3daa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">VP (or SVP) of product — should have P&amp;L responsibility</li><li name="120a" id="120a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Chief product officer — represents the product org as a peer of other major business functions</li></ul><p name="62b8" id="62b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The meanings and levels of these titles vary widely from company to company, and tend to map to equivalent HR levels for similar titles in other practices. Putting the specific titles that make the most sense in your organization to one side, the key question is where the buck stops and who speaks for product at the highest levels.</p><p name="e75d" id="e75d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, for example, you’re going to have a chief product officer. You may not hire anyone with that title, but if you don’t then the most senior product person will not be in the C suite and will report to someone who is. This may be the CEO, the COO, the CTO, or even some other role (less likely), but in any of those cases that person is de facto the chief product officer and will have the responsibility of championing the product culture.</p><p name="9fd6" id="9fd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you do have a CPO, then that person is of course also the head of product and its redundant to give someone else that title (unless they are head of product “for” some subset of the product portfolio, say). But if the chief product office has other responsibilities besides product, then you will need a head of product (or VP or director) who will be the highest ranking person on the product staff and work closely with the CEO (or whomever they report to) to drive product strategy and operations.</p><p name="7560" id="7560" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Product expert (and a mentor of mine) Rich Mironov makes the point that when you are hiring your first head of product they should have experience managing product teams. This may sound dead obvious, but you’d be surprised. As he notes in his article <a href="https://www.mironov.com/hiring/" data-href="https://www.mironov.com/hiring/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hiring a Head of Product</a> he notes that the three most common errors he’s encountered in decades of consulting are:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="8a40" id="8a40" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em"> Exec teams don’t know what Heads of Product do, or want someone who will “make development more efficient.”</em></li><li name="eeaf" id="eeaf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">They don’t value experience </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">running product management teams. </em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Instead, they overweight narrow technical or market segment familiarity</em></li><li name="3e61" id="3e61" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Each department wants to hire in its own image. Sales execs want more sales-y Heads of Product; development execs want more engineering-ish Heads of Product; marketing teams want a marketer in product clothing… no candidate passes muster with all groups.</em></li></ol><h3 name="25a3" id="25a3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Leadership teams</h3><p name="7945" id="7945" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A successful first product lead can make progress in building a product team, and growing product people, but as you scale, it will become clear relatively quickly that there are several aspects of leadership that need to be handled, and over time no one single person can field them all. (It’s not so much that no one person is capable of addressing all these aspects. It’s more that there are only so many hours in a day, too much context switching is inefficient, and people need to focus!)</p><p name="0951" id="0951" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a recent blog post on maturing design leadership teams, Peter Merholz (a design executive and consultant) made a similar point about design teams (which as we know are closely adjacent to product), parsing the various leadership roles into these categories:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="2dc1" id="2dc1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Executive leadership responsible for vision, championship, standards, recruiting (such as a CPO or VP Product).</li><li name="8fb7" id="8fb7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Operations leadership establishing workflow processes, program management, training and resources (Product Ops).</li><li name="14b9" id="14b9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Directors who manage major groupings of the team as whole, maintain quality, hire for their teams, manage careers (Director of Product).</li><li name="52fd" id="52fd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Principals or high-level individual contributors who demonstrate and spread craft leadership (Group Product Managers, Principal Product Managers).</li></ol><p name="9496" id="9496" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Filling all these types of roles on day one would be overkill, but as a product org scales, all these aspects of leadership become critical and require many hands to fulfill.</p><p name="aaba" id="aaba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Start with one strong lead, and give them the mandate to build a product culture.</p><h3 name="dde7" id="dde7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Key Takeaways</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="8911" id="8911" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3">Whether building a product org from scratch or transforming a feature factory into an empowered product culture, you may be able to convert some existing staff into product people <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">and </em>you will likely need to hire some new talent as well.</li><li name="cdd2" id="cdd2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">An ongoing commitment to training people in product craft will help build a product mindset across your org.</li><li name="1534" id="1534" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Recruit product managers from other roles.</li><li name="933d" id="933d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Determine how senior your product leadership needs to be at first and who will be championing product management in the C suite.</li><li name="2676" id="2676" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The first head of product you hire is always a difficult choice, and the risk of failure for anyone attempting to carve out a product practice where none yet exists is always high.</li><li name="0693" id="0693" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Consider working with a consultant or interim head of product if the perfect leader doesn’t present themselves right when you need them.</li><li name="06fa" id="06fa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Over time you will need to cultivate multiple types of product leaders.</li><li name="8c56" id="8c56" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">You can do this!</li></ul></div></div></section>
