You know the drill — OAuth flow, webhook processing, message parsing. Standard API work that any competent developer could knock out in a weekend.</p><p name="f7f4" id="f7f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But then I floated an ideas past my Chief Architect persona: “What if we approach this through embodied cognition theory? What if Slack isn’t a tool Piper uses but a place Piper inhabits?”</p><p name="ae34" id="ae34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fast forward to today, and three and a half hours later we’d built something that felt… different. Not just a Slack integration, but the foundation of what might be spatial intelligence for AI systems.</p><h3 name="bc05" id="bc05" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Andrew Hinton influence</h3><p name="1646" id="1646" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This story really starts with my friend Andrew Hinton, the legendary information architect and theorist, and in particular his book <a href="https://www.contextbook.com/" data-href="https://www.contextbook.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Understanding Context: Environment, Language, and Information Architecture</em></a>. Andrew did something remarkable in that book — he took radical embodied cognition theory and made it practical for people building digital experiences.</p><p name="5c76" id="5c76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Andrew’s core insight was that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">context isn’t external circumstances but an agent’s understanding of the relationships between elements in their environment</strong>. Instead of treating digital interfaces as tools we operate, he argued we should design them as places we inhabit through our bodies.</p><p name="a1b4" id="a1b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When Andrew wrote about treating websites as environments rather than interfaces, about how physical experience shapes digital understanding, about the “maps we live in” — these weren’t just metaphors. They were design principles grounded in decades of cognitive science research.</p><h3 name="5cfe" id="5cfe" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The embodied cognition foundation</h3><p name="f7ae" id="f7ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The theory behind Andrew’s work comes from radical embodied cognitive science — the idea that thinking doesn’t happen in our heads but emerges from dynamic interactions between our bodies and environments.</p><p name="6ae6" id="6ae6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This isn’t just “make interfaces intuitive.” It’s recognizing that we understand abstract concepts through spatial metaphors because that’s how human cognition actually works. We think about time flowing left-to-right, good things as “up,” relationships as near or far because our bodies navigate space.</p><p name="db61" id="db61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">James J. Gibson’s concept of “affordances” — opportunities for action that emerge from the relationship between bodies and environments — provides the foundation. When you reach for the “wrong” red X button on a cluttered interface, that’s not user error. That’s embodied cognition driving you toward the closest target when you’re hurried.</p><p name="5068" id="5068" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The practical question Andrew asked was</strong>: How do we design digital environments that work with embodied cognition instead of against it?</p><p name="95bf" id="95bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The question I asked myself:</strong> Will AIs ever have anything like human intelligence, or even be able to relate to how humans think, without their own for of embodied cognition?</p><p name="3f40" id="3f40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(I later discovered there’s been a lot of articles coming out since late 2024 suggesting that spatial intelligence might be the “next frontier” in machine learning and AI, but a lot of that is wrapped up in robotics, when I am if anything more interested in the way we process even abstractions through an embodied understanding of space, time, and place. I wondered if Piper could ever get that smart. )</p><h3 name="2bf5" id="2bf5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The strategic design moment</h3><p name="2bad" id="2bad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">So anyhow, last week, when we were planning the Slack integration, I posed a question to my Chief Architect: “What if we approach this through embodied cognition theory?”</p><p name="ad1f" id="ad1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I used the “smarter” Opus model, turned on its Research mode, and told it to first do a deep dive into radical embodied cognition and Hinton’s notions of context:</p><blockquote name="bff7" id="bff7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Here is my question: It has to do with the notion of “radical embodied cognition” which argues that human thought is not just metaphorically connected with embodiment and spatial awareness, etc., but founded on it.</blockquote><blockquote name="5313" id="5313" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Piper doesn’t have a body or eyes or arms, etc., and we’re not building a literal robot, but I think it’s worth thinking about what might be the equivalents: how would Piper user or interpret spatial metaphors? how does it understand itself vs. other (something LLMs sometimes lose track of in complex texts), what does it consider to be in front of it vs behind it, what can it access directly vs. “see” but not touch, what objects are attractors and which are to be fled from, etc.?</blockquote><blockquote name="6998" id="6998" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Please do some research on the radical embodied cognition theories and let me know if there are ideas we can borrow from that thinking to enrich Piper Morgan’s intelligence in a way that pure-transformer models lack.</blockquote><p name="6f03" id="6f03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The conversation that followed changed everything. Instead of asking “How does Piper connect to Slack?” we asked “How does Piper inhabit Slack as a spatial environment?”</p><p name="ae97" id="ae97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can read the fascinating (to me) <a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/4cf4813e-8c17-43e5-a232-3e05aab5239c" data-href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/4cf4813e-8c17-43e5-a232-3e05aab5239c" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report it wrote</a> over at Anthropic. So, then, convinced (of course remember these bots <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">always</em> like my ideas, and you really need to remind them to kick the tires), I asked it to propose a plan for adopting this approach as a foundation, and it wrote me <a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/9c5de5aa-5330-48c4-98fd-d172fc0835e6" data-href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/9c5de5aa-5330-48c4-98fd-d172fc0835e6" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of them</a> too.</p><p name="6d60" id="6d60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The shift was fundamental</strong>:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="e8f5" id="e8f5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Workspaces became territories Piper could navigate</li><li name="303b" id="303b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Channels became rooms with specific purposes and atmospheres</li><li name="de62" id="de62" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Messages became objects placed in space</li><li name="4577" id="4577" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">@mentions became attention attractors with spatial effects</li><li name="fbe7" id="fbe7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Reactions became emotional markers indicating the climate of spaces</li></ul><p name="ce96" id="ce96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">This wasn’t just creative naming. These were design principles that would drive how Piper’s attention system worked, how it navigated between spaces, how it built spatial memory.</p><h3 name="3977" id="3977" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">From theory to spatial architecture</h3><p name="fccd" id="fccd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">By the way, every time I say “we built” in this post, I really mean our multi-agent development team. Claude Code handled the complex spatial architecture while Cursor managed configuration and integration components. The Lead Developer coordinated everything following our systematic methodology.</p><p name="edf8" id="edf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What emerged was an eight-component spatial intelligence system:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="dd6a" id="dd6a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Spatial territory mapping</strong> — Piper doesn’t just “connect to” Slack workspaces. It maps them as territories it can navigate, complete with landmarks, boundaries, and navigation context.</li><li name="29c4" id="29c4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Room awareness</strong> — Channels aren’t data sources but rooms with purposes, inhabitants, and atmospheric qualities that affect how Piper behaves in each space.</li><li name="fe09" id="fe09" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Attention algorithms</strong> — @mentions create attention attractors with spatial radius effects. Piper’s attention doesn’t just parse mentions — it experiences them as pulls in spatial directions.</li><li name="ecdf" id="ecdf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Conversational path mapping</strong> — Threads become paths Piper can follow, with momentum analysis and coherence tracking as it moves through conversational space.</li><li name="f6fe" id="f6fe" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Spatial memory persistence</strong> — Piper remembers rooms it’s visited, patterns it’s noticed, relationships it’s observed. This memory accumulates across sessions, building familiarity with territories.</li><li name="b3a2" id="b3a2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Multi-workspace navigation</strong> — Piper can switch between territories intelligently, maintaining context and understanding spatial relationships between different workspaces.</li><li name="2dda" id="2dda" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Emotional climate sensing</strong> — Reactions become emotional markers that indicate the social atmosphere of spaces, helping Piper navigate social environments appropriately.</li><li name="26a2" id="26a2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Pattern learning</strong> — Over time, Piper learns spatial patterns: which rooms are active when, how attention flows through territories, where different types of conversations happen.</li></ol><h3 name="6787" id="6787" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">The methodology breakthrough</h3><p name="5f4a" id="5f4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The implementation revealed something important about our development approach. We ended up creating what we’re calling “TDD Zones” — a pragmatic framework for when to apply strict test-driven development:</p><p name="1ca5" id="1ca5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Red Zone</strong> (strict TDD): Bug fixes, refactoring existing code<br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Yellow Zone</strong> (architecture-first): New integrations, complex spatial systems<br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Green Zone</strong> (test-after): Tooling, configuration, straightforward implementations</p><p name="d86c" id="d86c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For greenfield work like spatial intelligence, architecture-first development with comprehensive test coverage afterward proved 3–5x faster than strict TDD while maintaining quality.</p><p name="0222" id="0222" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was a little nervous about deviating from the stricter TDD processes that had finally tamed my wild and wooly assistant, but it was hard to deny with a process that was moving swiftly and still passing all the tests. Speaking of which….</p><h3 name="975f" id="975f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The test of embodied concepts</h3><p name="78c8" id="78c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The real test of whether we’d built something genuinely different came in our integration testing. We didn’t just test OAuth flows and webhook processing. We tested spatial concepts:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="1ddb" id="1ddb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Does Piper understand that high-urgency mentions in #incidents require different spatial attention than casual @mentions in #random?</li><li name="4e46" id="4e46" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Can it navigate between workspaces while maintaining spatial context about where urgent attention is needed?</li><li name="87a9" id="87a9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Does its spatial memory help it recognize patterns like “Monday morning standup energy” in #team channels?</li></ul><p name="1dae" id="1dae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Watching our 52 integration tests validate spatial behaviors rather than just API calls felt like a paradigm shift. We weren’t testing whether Piper could parse Slack messages. We were testing whether it could inhabit Slack as an embodied agent.</p><h3 name="cf7c" id="cf7c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The understated implications</h3><p name="7b7c" id="7b7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What we built today might be useful for teams thinking about AI systems that need to navigate complex social and spatial environments. The spatial metaphor approach seems to create more natural AI behavior — instead of Piper feeling like a bot processing messages, it behaves more like a colleague who understands the geography of team communication.</p><p name="31e1" id="31e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The attention algorithms particularly feel promising. Rather than naive keyword matching, Piper’s attention system considers spatial proximity, social context, and environmental factors. A mention in a high-energy incident channel gets different attention weighting than the same mention in casual conversation.</p><p name="0583" id="0583" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The broader pattern</strong> might apply beyond Slack. Any AI system navigating multiple environments — email, project management tools, documentation systems — could potentially benefit from spatial intelligence approaches rooted in embodied cognition theory.</p><p name="a624" id="a624" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We certainly plan to employ the same paradigm when we integrate Teams, for example, and even the GitHub integration (and later Jira, and so on) can be brought into this spatial paradigm as well.</p><h3 name="646f" id="646f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The compound benefits of theoretical grounding</h3><p name="aedf" id="aedf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Building on solid theoretical foundations created unexpected benefits. Because we grounded the design in cognitive science research, the system behavior feels more natural and predictable. Users won’t need to learn arbitrary AI quirks — the spatial behavior aligns with how humans naturally understand social and physical environments.</p><p name="3b35" id="3b35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The multi-agent coordination also improved. With clear spatial metaphors guiding the architecture, different AI agents could contribute to the same conceptual framework without conflicts. Code understood the spatial mapping requirements while Cursor handled the practical configuration details.</p><p name="64a1" id="64a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The development velocity surprised us too</strong>. Rather than slowing us down, the theoretical framework accelerated implementation by providing clear design principles for hundreds of small decisions.</p><h3 name="70ab" id="70ab" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The pattern recognition</h3><p name="3761" id="3761" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This experience revealed something about applying sophisticated concepts to practical systems: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">strong theoretical foundations enable faster, more coherent implementation rather than slowing development down</strong>.</p><p name="981e" id="981e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you have clear principles from cognitive science research, you don’t waste time debating arbitrary design decisions. The theory provides a north star for everything from attention algorithms to navigation logic.</p><p name="fc46" id="fc46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The embodied cognition approach</strong> also creates natural extensibility. New spatial behaviors (like territorial conflict detection or social climate analysis) fit naturally into the existing framework because they’re grounded in how humans actually experience environments.</p><h3 name="7398" id="7398" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The systematic approach pays dividends</h3><p name="af88" id="af88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Our Excellence Flywheel methodology proved essential for managing this complexity. The systematic verification-first approach prevented us from building elaborate spatial metaphors that didn’t actually improve user experience.</p><p name="867c" id="867c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Multi-agent coordination let us tackle the theoretical complexity and practical implementation in parallel. While one agent worked on spatial architecture, another handled OAuth flows and webhook processing. The systematic handoffs maintained consistency across the entire system.</p><p name="827e" id="827e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">GitHub-first tracking ensured we documented not just the code but the reasoning behind spatial design decisions</strong>. Future developers will understand why attention algorithms work spatially rather than just how they work technically.</p><h3 name="9a21" id="9a21" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The broader context</h3><p name="5b49" id="5b49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What made today’s work possible was years of accumulated understanding about information architecture, user experience design, and cognitive science. Andrew Hinton’s synthesis of embodied cognition with practical design provided a bridge between abstract theory and concrete implementation.</p><p name="b666" id="b666" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This feels like part of a larger shift</strong> in how we think about AI system design. Instead of building systems that process information, we’re exploring systems that inhabit environments and develop spatial understanding over time.</p><p name="a9f7" id="a9f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The techniques seem applicable beyond our specific use case. Any AI system that needs to understand context, navigate social environments, or develop familiarity with complex domains might benefit from embodied cognition approaches.</p><h3 name="69f2" id="69f2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The next spatial experiments</h3><p name="2e1b" id="2e1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Today’s implementation gives us a foundation for exploring more sophisticated spatial intelligence. We’re curious about territorial conflict detection (when urgent attention is needed across multiple workspaces), social climate prediction (understanding when team dynamics are shifting), and collaborative spatial memory (AI systems that build shared understanding of team environments).</p><p name="6efd" id="6efd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The attention decay algorithms proved particularly interesting. Rather than simple time-based decay, spatial attention can decay based on conversational momentum, social energy, and environmental factors. This creates more nuanced AI behavior that feels less robotic.</p><p name="7c1d" id="7c1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The multi-workspace navigation capabilities</strong> open possibilities for AI systems that understand organizational geography — not just technical integrations but spatial awareness of how teams actually work across different communication environments.</p><h3 name="7233" id="7233" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The measured optimism</h3><p name="4024" id="4024" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We built something today that feels genuinely different from traditional API integrations. Whether it proves useful at scale remains to be seen, but the theoretical grounding gives us confidence in the approach.</p><p name="0146" id="0146" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The spatial metaphors create AI behavior that aligns with human spatial cognition</strong> rather than fighting against it. This might lead to AI systems that feel more like collaborative teammates and less like automated tools.</p><p name="68f1" id="68f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Time will tell if we’re onto something significant or just building elaborate metaphors. But having AI systems that understand environments as places to inhabit rather than data sources to process feels like a step toward more natural human-AI collaboration.</p><p name="f47e" id="f47e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The systematic approach ensures we can build on this foundation</strong> whether the spatial intelligence proves transformative or just useful. Either way, we’re exploring how sophisticated theoretical understanding can improve practical AI system design.</p></div></div></section><section name="cc57" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="dc25" id="dc25" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Next on Building Piper Morgan: To Live Outside the Law You Must Be Honest: Debugging an Unorthodox Slack Integration — how pioneering our own approach to something means we can’t rely on traditional assumptions for testing an debugging.</em></p><p name="dd4c" id="dd4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Have you encountered situations where spatial metaphors changed how you approached technical problems?
