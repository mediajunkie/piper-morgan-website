Business Acumen</h3><h4 name="8095" id="8095" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle">However product people may see themselves, a lot of the folks they work with, especially the creative types (designers and programmers), view them as “suits.” They’re the business drones. The ones who <em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">like</em> meetings. </h4><p name="d748" id="d748" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">In your quest for artistic and scientific-minded product people, don’t overcorrect and forget the “general manager” mindset that functions almost as a sort of superego, weighing the competing forces and arriving at a viable path forward.</p><h3 name="c8e8" id="c8e8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Sniffing out market opportunities</h3><p name="9834" id="9834" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The earliest-stage product skillsets in the business world deal with market research and discovering opportunities where there is a “job to be done” out there that can be done cheaply, more easily, or otherwise more valuably than the way people are getting that job done today.</p><p name="497a" id="497a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In an established business or market niche, this capability can help extend a product to a new market segment, expand it into a platform, or determine a related product to launch to further improve the “user journey” the core product supports.</p><p name="29d1" id="29d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In startups this is often the foundation work of validating the need for a product, service, or consulting business in a given market space at all, and there are as many ways to do that as there are forms of social science and economic research.</p><p name="75a4" id="75a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One way I saw this done was at CloudOn, a collaborative gesture-based document editor for tablets and phones (a company that we ultimately sold to Dropbox). My boss there, Jay Zaveri, believed long before the Microsoft Office or Google Docs teams shipped iPad apps that people would like to be more productive on their tablet, and respond to and edit their cloud documents on the go. </p><p name="5d83" id="5d83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To test this hypothesis, he bought some search text ads with a simple message along the lines of “Coming Soon! Edit your Word docs on the iPad” with a call-to-action link saying something like “Sign up to be notified.” </p><p name="8fa9" id="8fa9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now you could say this was advertising vaporware, but the idea that a way to edit Word documents on a touch-based tablet might be coming soon motivated thousands, eventually tens of thousands to sign up to be among the first to know.</p><p name="6145" id="6145" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Naturally, when CloudOn finally launched its 1.0 version in the App Store, this mailing list was notified and the ensuing rush to download the (free) software propelled it to the top 10 app list that day, which itself has a knock-on effect of driving thousands of additional downloads and installations organically.</p><h3 name="134b" id="134b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Growing and sustaining a market win into a business</h3><p name="53ab" id="53ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Having found product-market fit is an achievement worth celebrating. Without it, your product is really nowhere, but it’s only a necessary and not sufficient ingredient in turning a valuable product into a sustainable business.</p><figure name="e7bc" id="e7bc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*7V6UqDjttzBnsGCIo4ZFRg.jpeg" data-width="8660" data-height="5773" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7V6UqDjttzBnsGCIo4ZFRg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Differentiation usually involves aspects such as price, availability, quality and reliability.</figcaption></figure><p name="2701" id="2701" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Product people need to have an eye for “differentiators” — significant differences from the competition to stand out and make switching worthwhile. Note that the competition is frequently not another software product at all but rather the existing de factor manual process used to get that job done.</p><figure name="c29b" id="c29b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*-ebR25KisjTr7JSea0eH_Q.png" data-width="143" data-height="59" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-ebR25KisjTr7JSea0eH_Q.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Gmail’s first logo</figcaption></figure><p name="b54b" id="b54b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">When Google launched Gmail, the unlimited storage and threaded message display together represented much more than a small tweak to the preceding email experience. It felt like a leap forward. In the early days you had to be invited to beta test the new mail program and people were clamoring for those invitations out of a sense of envy toward the people already living in the future. Why can’t my mail be that easy, uncluttered, clear, etc.?</p><blockquote name="fe98" id="fe98" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">A small incremental improvement over the alternative is not a differentiator, as it rarely justifies the effort of migrating one’s data and habits to a new environment for a minor convenience.</blockquote><p name="7437" id="7437" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"> A really strong differentiator is sometimes referred to as a “moat” in the medieval sense of an impassible barrier protecting your outer walls. I’ve often heard advantages described as moats (“they’ll never be able to catch up on the research we did / all that data we’ve collected / the network effects of our huge user base”) but have never been told exactly what makes one defense impenetrable and another vulnerable. </p><p name="8dfa" id="8dfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Does Facebook have too many users to ever lose its monopoly on Internet sociality? Did MySpace?</p><h3 name="4031" id="4031" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">GM thinking</h3><p name="dcfa" id="dcfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You want your product people to be able to think like general managers because they will be the one person in many situations who can see the whole picture and has the ultimate responsibility to keep it thriving. </p><p name="4dd3" id="4dd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Operationally, this translates into setting goals, inspiring teams to focus on solving problems and achieving outcomes, measuring results carefully without fear or favor, and making critical decisions based on the available feedback and evidence to provide direction and drive the strategy forward.</p><p name="edf2" id="edf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nobody gets into a C suite without having heard “You can’t manage what you can’t measure” (or its variants) a thousand times or more. Because it’s true. It’s every bit as true for business goals and product strategy as it is for spoilage.</p><p name="d898" id="d898" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of this comes down to determining the critical metrics needed to steer by. They need to be captured with high fidelity, benchmarked, and then studied closely as they evolve. Your product people should be able to get down in the weeds with data and pursue all sorts of explanations and hypotheses, and at the same time, the whole company should be aware of one or two, three at the most “North Star metrics” that best represent progress toward the top goals of the quarter or year (or whatever other cycle you plan on).</p><p name="a0d8" id="a0d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If your company has embraced the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) method of defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), tracking them, and using them to measure success and learn from failure. be very careful about how a companywide OKR regime can make ordinary reporting and reviews more complex. OKRs are not supposed to be used to evaluate performance, but in practice they ofter are. Wherever you stand on the proper use of OKRs, be sure the whole company is on the same page and understands what to expect, if you want to avoid a lot of unnecessary anxiety.</p><p name="6d85" id="6d85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Product OKRs generally involve user engagement, behavior, or revenue data, and rely on well executed “product instrumentation” (the use of a tracking tool or convention such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Amplitude) to provide accurate insight into empirical customer behavior when interacting with your product.</p><p name="032e" id="032e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Great product people swim in this analytical data, set up dashboard and alerts, make reports for the rest of the company, post critical data updates in slack channels, and they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">notice</em> when something unusual is happening in the data before anyone else does.</p><h3 name="f847" id="f847" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Unknown unknowns</h3><p name="13c0" id="13c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Most product planning tends to address known challenges and opportunities. </p><p name="efb9" id="efb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The competitor has a better feature and you might want to invest in reaching parity with them on that function. </p><p name="a9a6" id="a9a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Data analyses and interviews tell your product people that customers would like some enhancements to a feature they already love a lot or that they are impatient with a bug that has gone unaddressed for a long time. </p><p name="0a68" id="0a68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The school year starts in the fall so the new product for students needs to be advertised in late summer. We should outsource the maintenance of this legacy product to an external engineering team. Things like that.</p><p name="fe25" id="fe25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But there is another source of challenge and opportunity that may present new information and circumstances to you at any time. Essentially: externalities that are beyond your control. This can range to what used to more of be called “acts of God” such as floods, famines, earthquakes, World Cup victories, and so on, to more mundane unexpected news such as your leading competitor closing a venture round or the suicide of a pop star driving a wave of new users into your mental health product’s community.</p><blockquote name="90f3" id="90f3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">At 7 Cups we had a saying: “The problem is the path.” It meant that if we faced our problems squarely and studied the reality of the situation deeply, we would find the solutions we needed. (This worked, like 80% of the time.)</blockquote><p name="a86f" id="a86f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It’s tempting to ignore such unpredictable externalities because, well, they’re unpredictable, but the best product people stay aware that a substantial part of any future being planned for will surprise us, and that the best plans remain flexible and resilient and have contingencies as well as general principles and practices about how to respond in the face of new circumstances whether adverse or opportunistic.</p><p name="d288" id="d288" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the PathCheck Foundation, the software we shipped initially in April used GPS protocols to assist contact tracers in a privacy-preserving way to more efficiently and accurately gather potential exposure data from people diagnosed with Covid-19 who volunteered to participate. Several jurisdictions launched with this platform. At the same time the R&amp;D team was exploring many other sensor models, including blue tooth and wifi signals, among others.</p><p name="302b" id="302b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then, in the early summer, Google and Apple announced a partnership to develop and publish a set of “exposure notification” protocols that would rely entirely on Bluetooth and that could not be used in any product that captured location data. Their teams even reached out to ours and told us that our “thought leadership” around surveillance-free digital contact tracing had inspired some of the privacy-preserving architectural choices in their protocols and APIs.</p><p name="22a7" id="22a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For PathCheck, this meant we needed to pivot! </p><p name="b94e" id="b94e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As much as we believed in the value of our GPS-based solution and were committed to supporting the partner jurisdictions launching with it, we had to recognize that the makers of the two dominant mobile app device operating systems represented the mother of all 800 lb gorillas, and that they were going to strongly determine the direction of the market we were playing in from that point forward.</p><p name="7322" id="7322" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, we engaged deeply with Google and Apple, helped many jurisdictions navigate the shifting technical and political waters to determine what solution worked best for them, and developed a Google-Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) product combining the best aspects of our product discovery and user experience design with the new realities of the bluetooth-based exposure notifications model.</p><h3 name="be5b" id="be5b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What to expect in a roadmap</h3><p name="89d2" id="89d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As business leader, you want to see the product roadmap. This is natural. Where is the product headed? Is it on track? What are we getting in upcoming releases? Have they fixed my pet peeve bug yet? These are all natural questions. Unfortunately, this can sometimes lead to product teams presenting to you release plans and calling them roadmaps.</p><p name="5de8" id="5de8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be clear, both things are good and necessary business communications artifacts!</p><p name="a1b6" id="a1b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A release plan is something a project manager or release manager should be able to maintain. It provides a schedule of upcoming releases with some indication of what changes to expect in each release. It is needed to coordinate marketing and advertising, to make deadlines for commitments to partners, to launch during the right time of year, to beat the competition. All the things schedules are good for.</p><p name="7dac" id="7dac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A roadmap is not a schedule, though, or should not be. It’s a plan for the way ahead. It can be loosely correlated with time frames, of course, but again those details find more accurate expression in a release plan anyhow.</p><p name="dd17" id="dd17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The roadmap is your product team’s primary artifact reflecting the current product strategy, which itself should be an expression of the product-dependent aspects of the business strategy for the current time period (quarter, fiscal year, ten-year plan).</p><p name="fa13" id="fa13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The best kind of roadmap is organized by objectives (mapped back to OKRs, ideally), often structured along tracks where successive advances toward an objective can be prioritized, with broad time frames such as Now, Next, and Later (my favorite way to do it).</p><figure name="6398" id="6398" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*XIysoElwNrYtMEAoh-d2_A.png" data-width="1239" data-height="552" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XIysoElwNrYtMEAoh-d2_A.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Here is the public-facing roadmap (or the top of each column, at least, for Prodpad, a roadmap product for product managers. How meta is that?</figcaption></figure><p name="6759" id="6759" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Now</strong> is literally what the team is working on right now. What is being built and shipped, what is being researched and defined. It can often loosely be thought of as “this quarter” although that is sometimes less true around the change of quarter.</p><p name="de79" id="de79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Next</strong> is what the team hopes to move onto when the things they are doing now are done. Most of them will be further steps along the tracks mentioned above. Agile iterative processes mean that it’s not aways clear in advance what the specific ideas involved in that further step will be, but steering closer to the track’s objective is the driving force in making those choices when the time comes. Some of the work that the product team is leading “now” is preparation for work that the dev team will be leading “next.” This can loosely be mapped to the next few quarters, say three to nine months out.</p><p name="ee49" id="ee49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Later</strong> is an aspiratonal parking lot of great ideas for where to go after all the things that the team wants to get to next are nailed down. The details are even sketchier becuase they really don’t need or deserve too much attention yet. They are to some extent placeholders to remember where the team thought they were headed back when they were first mapping out the future.</p><p name="f22d" id="f22d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As time grinds on and “now” stuff gets done and “next” stuff turns into “now” stuff, some of the “later” stuff of course ends up on-deck under next and starts demanding a bit more refinement and attention, so this is a living evolving document reflecting the best view of the future the product team is able to articulate at this time.</p><p name="a510" id="a510" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It can drive fantastic conversations but it’s not really good for “why did we miss that ship date?”</p><h3 name="43b9" id="43b9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Growth</h3><p name="27b2" id="27b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Another critical instinct you want in at least some of your product people is a nose for growth. They need not necessarily be hired or chartered as “growth hackers” but having some of your product people focused like a laser on how to improve your key north star metrics can introduce a helpful tension to planning aligned with goals.</p><p name="91f9" id="91f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some of the most common growth metrics involve things such as unique active users in a time period: Daily active users (DAU), weekly active users (WAU), monthly active users (MAU) as well as ratios among the same.</p><p name="0a6e" id="0a6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can also expect the product team to measure user activation and user engagement. Critical to active user growth is to maximize retention (and, thus, on the other side of the coin, minimize churn), and you may also be trying to drive your “bounce rate” (people who visit your product and then leave without engaging at all) as close to zero as possible.</p><p name="5289" id="5289" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After user growth metrics, the next most common (and in many cases by far the most important) category is revenue metrics. This can be anything from raw transaction, number of paying users or subscribers, versions of all the same retention, churn, re-engagement type metrics used with active user growth, to calculations of customer lifetime value (LTV), customer acquisition cost (CAC), the all important ration of LTV/CAC, as well as old school product metrics such as cost of goods sold (COGS) with its impact on the profit bottom line.</p><p name="15e5" id="15e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A third category of growth metric is virality. In the customer life cycle how many of the people who become of aware of the product actually discover it, how many of those engage with it at all, how many become active users, how many are retained, how many are loyal, how many are enthusiastic, and what fraction of them are ambassadors or evangelists who are actively promoting your product to new customers (putting people back into the top of this funnel at awareness)?</p><p name="2cc2" id="2cc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The coefficient of virality, then, is the average number of referral to new customers times the conversion rate. If you can get this up above 1.0 then your customer base is growing on its own. The higher the viral coefficient, the faster that growth. </p><blockquote name="8e88" id="8e88" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">In light of the coronavirus, I wonder if we can find another mathematically accurate term for beneficial spread that lacks these epidemiological overtones?</blockquote><figure name="0410" id="0410" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*C23_jDlYKCxpzzPrutYhng.png" data-width="738" data-height="415" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*C23_jDlYKCxpzzPrutYhng.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Viral growth (enthusiastic word of mouth backed by a streamlined invitation and signup flow) has spurred Slack to greater and greater height in the enterprise collaboration software space (image from a Josh Constine article on TechCrunch, “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/01/rocketship-emoji/" data-href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/01/rocketship-emoji/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Slack’s growth is insane, with daily user count up 3.5X in a year</a>”).</figcaption></figure><h3 name="dab8" id="dab8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Instigators vs sustainers</h3><p name="bbba" id="bbba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">One last note about product people as business operators: Some product people are better suited to starting new things and others are better at taking a going concern and bringing out the best in it. Both types are needed.</p><p name="10c7" id="10c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instigators love launching stuff. They make great serial entrepreneurs. They are full of creative hypotheses and their bias to action tends to be maxed out. They also get bored once problems are solved and it’s time to make that second million. Keep giving them new horizons to conquer!</p><p name="0e4a" id="0e4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sustainers are equally valuable. The instigators may shake their heads wondering how someone could stand the boredom of growing a successful product into an even more successful one with a long lifespan. But sustainers find this to be the most satisfying work. Like sailing a well built ship efficiently over the seas, as opposed to building a raft in the middle of an ocean. Put these people to work optimizing your core products.</p><blockquote name="9e64" id="9e64" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">All good things come to an end, and one of the less glamorous but no less critical responsibilities of product is pulling the plug on features, product, product lines, and even businesses that have outlived their usefulness.
