What Exactly Does a Product Manager Do?</h3><p name="de56" id="de56" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--h3"><span class="graf-dropCap">If</span> you’re not sure what product managers do, you’re not alone. Quite a few hiring managers — not to mention entire businesses — are also confused about this. It doesn’t help that there are a wide variety of legitimate approaches to product management that tend to emphasize one or another of the constituent proficiencies at the expense of the others.</p><p name="3927" id="3927" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As confusing as this may seem, there are multiple legitimate approaches to product management in practice today (as well as some pretty broken approaches) because the work itself depends so heavily on context. That being said, every product management has the same core responsibility.</p><blockquote name="6613" id="6613" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Towards the end of this year Rosenfeld Media will be publishing my book <a href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/product-management-for-ux-designers/" data-href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/product-management-for-ux-designers/" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Product Management for UX People: From Designing to Thriving in a Product World</em></a> (you may sign up there to be notified when it is available for order), the culmination of a multiple-year project that has unfolded with the input and support of the <a href="https://designinproduct.typeform.com/to/H4PqHsVE" data-href="https://designinproduct.typeform.com/to/H4PqHsVE" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Design in Product</em> community</a>.</blockquote><blockquote name="19d7" id="19d7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">During the editorial and production process I am sharing early drafts of chapters, and I welcome any feedback here that will strengthen the material.</blockquote><p name="d73a" id="d73a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The product manager is responsible for value, through the coordination and delivery of customer experiences. for making sure that the experience being delivered to customers (and of to other stakeholders in the system) provides enough value to be “hired” by the user and developed as a sustainable concern, ideally in service of a broader vision.</p><p name="0dc4" id="0dc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">OK, but sustainable in what sense? That is a broad goal. LinkedIn product lead and social change evangelist B. Pagels-Minor suggests at least one dimension of this: “something the user values and repeatedly uses.” In addition to that, a sustainable system of any kind, business or otherwise, needs to find repeatable cycles of inputs and outcomes that sustain the system if they aren’t to wind down eventually if only through entropy. Some inputs (usually related to people, money, or both) need to be steady or growing, and what you build has to both rely upon and replenish these consistent flowing cycles.</p><p name="d1a1" id="d1a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first person who taught me to focus on “value” as the lodestar of product management was Jay Zaveri, who was my chief product officer at the time and now runs a product incubator at Social Capital, a VC firm in Palo Alto.</p><p name="b178" id="b178" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I checked back in with him because when people ask what defines value, it’s hard to avoid circularity of the “you know it when you see it variety.” Some emphasize value to the whole system vs. monetary value or value that accrues to the owner of the organization alone. When I pressed him, Jay put it this way:</p><blockquote name="303f" id="303f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Value is something special that a person or customer experiences that never existed in the same way for them in the past — it’s a product that is useful, usable, and desirable. </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Value</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> fulfills a deep need, desire, or want for the customer </em>that they did not even know existed<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">. It’s apparent when something is technologically differentiated (“cheaper, faster, better”), abundantly available (“accessible in a way that was only available to few before”), and changes human behavior (in a way that is beneficial to the person or customer).</em></blockquote><p name="f996" id="f996" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I pressed him a bit on who <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">gets</em> this value and he said “I think people get confused by adding financial metrics as value metrics. Some of those are necessary but not sufficient, and some are pure garbage. No true value is created by just financial and growth metrics, in fact we now know there are serious unintended consequences to be focussed only on them. Nothing beats staying focused on true value to customer — everyone wins!”</p><p name="357e" id="357e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So think of it this way: any sustaining <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">value</em> to the organization (it could be a government or collective, etc — this concept does not depend on the organization being a for-profit business) derives by taking a fair share of the value created for the “customer” (end user, subject, actor, protagonist).</p><p name="030f" id="030f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Responsibility for value helps clarify a few roles that are often confused with product managers:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4b4d" id="4b4d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">project managers</li><li name="3a3b" id="3a3b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">product owners</li></ul><p name="7384" id="7384" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Before digging into the building blocks of product management, let’s first get a few things defined and distinguished.</p><h3 name="2a80" id="2a80" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A product manager is not a project manager</h3><p name="e341" id="e341" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Product managers are mixed up with project managers all the time. Even people who know the difference will occasionally confuse them in speech. Abbreviations are no help, as both are commonly referred to as PMs with only context making the meaning clear (sometimes that context is “this company doesn’t have any project managers” or vice versa, other times it’s based on the speaker, the team, and the conversation itself).</p><blockquote name="8efb" id="8efb" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Author Note: Forget PrM or ProM, too. Still no distinguishing characters. You have to get And I haven’t met anyone yet who wants to go around calling them ProjM’s and ProdM’s, or PjMs and PdMs for that matter. <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">In this book, PM stands for Product Manager.</strong></blockquote><p name="0a38" id="0a38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">To make things worse, project management can be one of the responsibilities of a product manager. PMs <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">care</em> a lot about schedules, know how to read a gantt chart, strive to keep everything on track, and work to hold everyone to their commitments, but this should only ever be a sliver of their time and attention.</p><p name="b4f1" id="b4f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A project manager is a specialist whose subject matter knowledge helps them excel at understanding the fine points but whose core expertise is keeping projects on track, on time, and on budget.</p><p name="7f44" id="7f44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some project managers do become product managers and when they do, just as with UX designers, they must master a whole series of adjacent skills beyond “keeping the trains running on time.”</p><blockquote name="374b" id="374b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Author Note: Heck, if this book takes off, stay tuned for Product Management for Software Engineers, Product Management for Project Managers, and so on!</blockquote><p name="7429" id="7429" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Product consultant and author Matt LeMay, co-founder of Sudden Compass puts it this way: “Product managers have both the opportunity and the responsibility to ask ‘why?’”</p><h3 name="6960" id="6960" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A product manager is also not a product owner</h3><p name="5397" id="5397" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Another terminology thing to get straight right off the bat is the difference between a product manager and a product owner. Putting aside the fact that practices differ widely and there are certainly examples of companies out there using these terms indiscriminately, it’s important to try to keep their meanings distinct.</p><p name="935a" id="935a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A product manager focuses and orchestrates the efforts of a cross-disciplinary team to ship valuable software experiences as part of accomplishing strategic business goals.</p><p name="48ee" id="48ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A product owner is a role in the most common agile scrum operational processes who shapes and guides the engineering team as they develop software. In this model they are a bit like a very tactical product manager, primarily focused on the backlog, running sprints, and iteratively toward goals, but this is an engineer-centric model invented in the absence of true product managers.</p><p name="229c" id="229c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Originally, the product owner tended to be drawn from among the engineers, and some teams use a specialized scrum master role that requires training and certification in most cases and which focuses on the project management dimensions of an agile scrum development environment. Product owners from the engineering team are sometimes a team lead but not alway, and there are many variations on this approach in practice today, including teams where the primary business stakeholder is the product owner, or government contexts in which the product owner is the person ultimately responsible for what ships, more of a head of product or what some academic projects call a “primary investigator.”</p><p name="bc19" id="bc19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Product owner activities likewise can and often are part of the work of a product manager, to the extent that some shops even treat Product Owner as an entry- or low-level Product Manager job title, but again this somewhat obscures the origin of the role from outside of the product management tradition.</p><h3 name="19c1" id="19c1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Where did product managers come from?</h3><p name="fd47" id="fd47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">So what is that tradition? Why does everyone now seem to speak in terms of “products” at all in this digital age, and why are the people called upon to pull it all together called “product managers”?</p><p name="4fa9" id="4fa9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The deep history of product management comes from 20th century concepts of marketing, which itself emerged as an attempt to really understand that potential customer and to be more scientific about measuring the size of the market, the reach of a product, and so on (some of this should sound familiar, as new generations rediscover these ideas and frame them in terms of research, humans, users, experience, experimentation, or analysis).</p><p name="8ff2" id="8ff2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The product metaphor itself is thus a bit double-edged in the internet age. The value it offers is to help focus and concretize the offering you are building to meet the needs of real people, or do jobs for them, or ease their journeys, and so on.</p><p name="a068" id="a068" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the very real need to be specific and clear about what you are making (and what you are not) can easily hide the slippery nature of online <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">products</em>, which differ from their industrial counterparts in two major ways that both fall under the heading of “actually being a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">service</em>”:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="0be1" id="0be1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">In contrast to physical products in the old “packaged widget in a box on a shelf” sense, most software made these days is SaaS (software as a service), hosted in the cloud, accessible via the web and sometimes with native app clients, and thus resistant to some of the finite constraints of the manufacturing process (sunk costs, waterfall processes, limited ability to make affordable changes once the product starts shipping).</li><li name="c209" id="c209" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">They also tend to be services in the sense of working for or providing assistance to their users in an ongoing way (vs. the concrete experience of using an object or tool).</li></ol><p name="820a" id="820a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Regardless of the subtext of the word product and the mental frames that may get dragged along by its use, it has emerged as a way of talking about the product-and-or-service being built to meet the needs of real people in a valuable way.</p><p name="8d57" id="8d57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A mid-20th century product manager would have almost always been someone with a business background, if not a degree in business, and the earliest digital equivalents inherited some of that DNA.</p><h3 name="cdbd" id="cdbd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Product as business manager</h3><p name="0bb3" id="0bb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Product management to this day is perceived by most as a business discipline or practice and responsibility for the business case, business strategy, and financial viability of a product remain core to the role.</p><p name="3b43" id="3b43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This can be a negative stereotype: the “suit,” the bean-counter, the boss man who only cares about the bottom line, and there are plenty of people with product titles out there living up to those clichés. But it doesn’t have to be! UX designers interested in understanding product management would do well to start by embracing the realities, the necessities, and even the joy of business. It doesn’t have to be a dirty word!</p><p name="5cfa" id="5cfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the product manager role first emerged in large software and other tech companies, it came with that business foundation and might be paired with technology or balanced by engineering and then one or more other pillars (such as clinical expertise in a health enterprise, for example, or editorial content in a media company, R&amp;D, or other core competencies depending upon the nature of the business).</p><p name="720e" id="720e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The equivalent role emerging at Microsoft at the time was called Program Manager. Today, program management usually refers to a separate (though highly adjacent) discipline dedicated to operational execution of complex programs generally consisting of multiple ongoing interrelated projects.</p><p name="e9ce" id="e9ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These PMs nearly always had MBAs and at times rubbed seasoned engineers and designers the wrong way when “put in charge” directly out of school.</p><p name="baf6" id="baf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A number of business titles and roles have contributed to how product management is practiced today, and along the way many people have done product management work under these titles, roles such as business analyst, product marketer, customer success specialist, and others. Execution related business skills such as (as noted previously) project management, decision making, strategic alignment and leadership figure in there somewhere as well.</p><p name="7e1e" id="7e1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A couple of years back I was part of a team led by Matte Scheinker charged with raising the product bar at AOL, which had newly spun off from its disappointing Time/Warner merger and was playing catchup with a decade-old style of web development. One of the things we did was review and update the HR ladders for product managers and UX designers, indicating what level of accomplishment is required across a series of criteria to be hired at or promoted to each level from associate to VP (with an individual-contributor track leading to principal, at the director level for the designers).</p><p name="f432" id="f432" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The old grid required the product managers have an MBA. We removed this. The HR department asked us if we could make it “MBA preferred” but we said that this wasn’t the case. If anything we were MBA-neutral. An MBA might help make a PM better at the business side of the role or it might not. The time spent getting the MBA yields one set of experiences and contacts and the equivalent time spent working yields another. By itself, the degree doesn’t tell you much. We weren’t penalizing anybody for having an MBA!</p><p name="c9e4" id="c9e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sometimes the business aspect of the role is summarized with a saying, “The product manager is the CEO of the product,” but this really isn’t true. The only value of that expression is that in an extremely broad way it suggests that the PM has a business responsibility for their product (or feature, or series of products) that is central and critical. The buck stops with the product manager.</p><p name="0cd1" id="0cd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the expression is frankly more misleading than helpful because CEOs control the budget, CEOs can hire or fire the team, and just about everybody reports up (ultimately) to the CEO. Product managers have business responsibility, sure, but they do not wield anything like CEO power.</p><p name="8a20" id="8a20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Joff Redfern, a VP of Product at Atlassian (and formerly LinkedIn and Facebook) prefers to frame this aspect of the role as thinking like a general manager. This has some of the same limitations in terms of direct authority but more closely matches the notion of one person with business-related responsibility for a coherent chunk of work.</p><p name="c53a" id="c53a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Clement Kao of Product HQ points out the GMs also have hiring and firing responsibilities and prefers to frame these operational and strategic leadership aspects as being “both coaches and janitors.”</p><p name="eb9f" id="eb9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alongside this business-focused type of product manager, the turn of the millennium saw some managers and lead developers emerge from engineering departments and take on product management roles, sometimes, at first, de facto in the absence of a true product practice, but more generally as a new career path open to engineering managers.</p><h3 name="d92c" id="d92c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Product as marketing manager</h3><p name="1567" id="1567" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Another antecedent of today’s product manager roles is the concept of a marketing manager or even a product marketing manager. This is the historical origin of the role in 20th century business practices and the obsession with customer needs inherent in product management derives from this fundamental DNA. The obsessions today with addressing markets and achieving product-market fit are other elements of continuity with the marketing orientation of early product management.</p><p name="32ba" id="32ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Both roles still exist as distinct positions in many organizations. This can potentially lead to turf or coordination issues when the product manager wants to approach product/marketing issues from a product-centric point of view and the product marketing manager wants to approach these same issues from a marketing-centric framework.</p><p name="21ab" id="21ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The article “<a href="https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-manager-vs-product-marketing-manager/" data-href="https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-manager-vs-product-marketing-manager/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Product Marketing Manager vs. Product Manager: Where Do You Draw the Line?</a>” does a nice job of delineating these roles and making a case for them being separate, boiling down the essence to this:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="0cde" id="0cde" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Product <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">management’s</em> role is strategic oversight</li><li name="df7c" id="df7c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Product <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">marketing’s</em> role is message creation</li></ul><h3 name="6c86" id="6c86" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Product as engineering manager</h3><p name="0837" id="0837" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Given that the context of all of this is software and technology, science and engineering, on some level any product manager in the internet age is a technical product manager, at least in the eyes of people who don’t work in tech. (In practice, roles defined as “technical product managers” almost always require a computer science or analytical or subject matter expertise with the specific technical approach of the business.)</p><p name="5048" id="5048" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Engineers with big-picture skills (such as technical design and architecture), a vision for the purpose and value of what the team is building, and the ability to debate pros and cons with other stakeholders to make the case for a specific direction, may find they have greater leverage and ability to steer the ship as product managers.</p><p name="a33f" id="a33f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The influx of engineer-trained PMs into the field thus started rebalancing the mix of skills expected from product people, with the business sense still a core orientation and now coupled with a deep mastery of the technical issues involved in software development.</p><p name="1f75" id="1f75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the role is literally advertised as a “technical product manager” or at a engineering-led company such as Google or any of its many imitators, the job application will include several technical interviews involving puzzles and problem-solving questions very similar to the ones presented to programmers, without necessarily requiring writing any code.</p><p name="0793" id="0793" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Questions involving sorting, efficiency, algorithmic complexity, etc., reflect product cultures that are heavily centered on engineering skill sets, experience, and frames of reference.</p><p name="5d9b" id="5d9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Google is famous both for making product managers “earn” engineering resources and buy in. There’s no guarantee that producing a spec means anyone will build it for you. But Google is also famous for cultivating and empowering product managers. The Associate Product Manager program with its structured training and rotation that Marissa Meyer pioneered there has been widely imitated at other aspiring tech giants.</p><p name="fc1c" id="fc1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But again, the type of product manager favored in shops with Google or Google-adjacent cultures tends to be highly technical, hence these brain-teaser type interview sessions that really only make sense as a filter for programming-capable minds and not so much as the far-fetched notion that the PM will routinely debate the “<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithms-big-o-analysis/" data-href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithms-big-o-analysis/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big-O complexity</a>” of several competing algorithmic approaches.</p><p name="92aa" id="92aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I still fondly recall a day I spent on the Google campus being interviewed and taken to lunch by a sequence of eleven white men of varying ages and hair colors and degrees of athleticism or geekiness. Many of the interviews were a lot of fun and to be honest I’ve always liked puzzles, although not so much under pressure with big bucks at stake. They rotate these questions over time so you can usually find expired examples with a little searching. For example, I was asked at one point how an algorithm might work to efficiently zero in on the correct five-digit passcode on a keypad, given certain rules or constraints about the numbers (to do with repetition, etc.). As I said, it was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">almost fun.</em></p><p name="467d" id="467d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And to be fair, nowadays most decent places that pose challenges like this encourage them to collaborate with you and help you along with your thinking. (If a role like that is your goal and you aren’t a computer scientist, there are books to help you cram. More about navigating career paths later.)</p><p name="0256" id="0256" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I was at Yahoo, I once asked how the product manager role evolved there, given that the Product organization was a peer to, and in many ways equally powerful as, the Engineering organization, and I was told that at the very beginning, Yahoo’s web sites were planned and built by people called “producers” (adopting terminology from media and broadcasting).</p><p name="621e" id="621e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over several years these jobs gained in complexity and ultimately diverged into two distinct roles, one focused on planning and directing what got built (product managers) and the other doing the actual building (front-end engineers). It actually took some time for the front-end developers to be accepted as peers in the engineering organization, given prejudices at the time against HTML markup and the other front-end languages, but the significance here is that the product role, at least at one of the 90s era Internet tech companies (“dot coms”), shared a common ancestor with a programming job.</p><p name="c8d0" id="c8d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fast forward to today and the role is still a highly technical one. A strong UX practitioner is going to take a serious interest in the technology she is designing with and for, just as an artist takes pains to understand their materials, but at the same time the designer is empowered to explore possibilities without constantly bringing to mind the apparent limitations of the existing technical stack and codebase.</p><p name="6a78" id="6a78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Product managers (and not just “technical product managers”), by contrast, must delve even more deeply into the substance and properties and limitations of the technologies being worked with and never really have the luxury of putting those factors to one side. (PMs also spend much more time working directly with engineers than most UX designers do, which creates further pressure to demonstrate a thorough command of the technical factors that figure into any difficult decision.)</p><p name="4452" id="4452" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The new hybrid eng/biz type product model still left a lot to be desired as practiced as most companies still follow waterfall and command-and-control software development lifecycle practices, but in the first decade or so of the millennium a few influential practitioners studying what worked well in silicon valley started articulating a fresh model of “lean” and “agile” and “fully empowered” product management.</p><h3 name="f161" id="f161" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Product as experimental explorer</h3><p name="9fec" id="9fec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Marty Cagan, a consultant with the Silicon Valley Product Group and author of the book <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Inspired, </em>among others, made a strong case for fully empowering your product team to investigate problem spaces, conduct discovery processes, meet customers and prospects face to face, and to seek to deeply understand what people need and what they will love to bring valuable products to the market.</p><p name="fbd0" id="fbd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve also learned a huge amount from Rich Mironov, a product consultant who advises companies, takes interim product executive roles (he calls this “smoke jumping”) and writes and teaches workshops. They and others have sought to raise the bar and to highlight the most effective techniques, approaches, and mindsets, while remaining clear-eyed and cautionary about the institutional patterns and incentives that can push back against these approaches.</p><p name="f519" id="f519" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, an empowered product team should understand the goals and outcomes it is seeking and be engaged in a process of iterating experimentally toward meeting those goals. The team should be capable of communicating to others what the current snapshot of the plan is, in the form of a roadmap (much more on this to come), expressed in terms of what is underway right now, what is coming up next, and what is expected to come “later.”</p><p name="7192" id="7192" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many leaders in traditional organizations balk when they see a roadmap communicated this way, especially if what they had in mind when they asked to see the roadmap was really a set of firm release dates on which clearly defined features will be delivered and launched.</p><p name="5b64" id="5b64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But committing to deliver a feature on a date certain based on a fully baked specification is a recipe for disaster. That process is too brittle and fails in the face of new information, data from users, stakeholders, changing market conditions, just to name a few.</p><p name="3dbf" id="3dbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the same notion from the “lean” movement, popularized by Eric Reis’ Lean Startup book: The product manager in an empowered team is facilitating a constant cycle that involves learning from what is currently “shipped” and “in the wild,” feeding these insights back into renewed discovery processes driven by qualitative inquiry to explore hypotheses and seek understanding, redefinition of the problem space, identification of further opportunities or experiments worth exploring, decisions about what to build or fix next, and shipping to start the cycle anew.</p><p name="c6dc" id="c6dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This cycle can be modeled in great detail but is most often reduced to “Build, Measure, Learn”:</p><figure name="9e65" id="9e65" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*tb5wd5ie4O1oSDPpfNiN6w.png" data-width="450" data-height="424" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tb5wd5ie4O1oSDPpfNiN6w.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Figure 1.1: “Build, measure, learn” is a simple but powerful model that lies at the heart of lean product management, with its bias to action and emphasis on learning and experimentation.</figcaption></figure><p name="b8d1" id="b8d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It’s worth noting that despite the title and the fact that it’s a cycle, you generally do not start with building. You start by learning something or by measuring (initially, assessing) something, learning something about, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">then</em> building a thing.</p><p name="6e90" id="6e90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This process of constant learning, feeding back into discovery, redefinition of problems and opportunities, and iterative design applies in early stages while prototyping new ideas as well as throughout the life of a product. The approach is still gaining adherents (and you might have noticed the way folks like Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden have worked hard to bring lean ideas about experimentation to the UX community). Outside of innovative tech companies and startups, though, the ideas of a product manager as experimenter (or “mad scientist”) is not as fully distributed and accepted.</p><p name="a325" id="a325" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But all product managers work with data and spend hours every week studying it closely. Whatever the cycle of learning and iteration, the job cannot be done without accurate signals about what is working and how the software is actually being used, and this focus on managing what you can measure carries through all of these strands mentioned so far: business, engineering, and entrepreneurial experimentation.</p><p name="a0e0" id="a0e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most recent archetype to contribute superpowers to the ideal product manager is one you should be familiar with: the designer.</p><h3 name="7e13" id="7e13" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Product as creative artist</h3><p name="9940" id="9940" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The experimentalist product manager is already more of a creative type than a simple number cruncher or bean counter. This is someone intensely exploring possibilities and looking for ways to discover new solutions to acute problems.</p><p name="6a41" id="6a41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The rise of user experience design in all its various forms and schools of thought, alongside the business-school friendly IDEO-adjacent notion of “design thinking” coincided in the culture with widespread awareness of the creative mythology of Apple computer, the heroic figure of Steve Jobs, and for design aficionados, the brilliant founder / CEO / marketers’s collaboration with industrial designer Jonathan Ive.</p><p name="29e8" id="29e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Suddenly, creative founders were getting funding for their own startups. Other startups were making their first design hire much earlier in the process. Design (or its abstracted cousin “design thinking”) offer proven methods for harnessing creativity and inventing innovative solutions to interesting problems.</p><p name="f981" id="f981" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Product management evolved as well. Where once PMs paid lip service to UX design, made their own wireframes based on zero research and asked designers to, more or less, color them in; now product practitioners started taking user experience research and design seriously as core disciplines with invaluable, unavoidable skills, techniques, and mindsets required to develop product experiences people will love and return to time and time again.</p><p name="0035" id="0035" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The lean movement had already shifted focus emphatically onto the customer (or potential customer) and user experience research and design conveniently revolves around this exact same obsession, has methods and traditions for learning from customers, and provides systems and models and tools for exploring and communication solutions.</p><p name="1ce5" id="1ce5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Design also excels at redefining problems and questioning prior assumptions, and much like UX design leads, product managers are charged with inspiring and rallying creativity in others. So alongside the business heads, coders, and founder types turning into product managers, some user experience designers, managers, directors, and VPs now jump to the adjacent product track as their careers evolve.</p><h3 name="ed94" id="ed94" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Three other traits shared by all great product managers</h3><p name="35aa" id="35aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Great product managers tends to be:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4792" id="4792" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Curious</li><li name="1979" id="1979" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Connecting</li><li name="ac52" id="ac52" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Courageous</li></ul><p name="7c5c" id="7c5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Curious</strong> almost to the extent of feeling like a busybody, being nosy, wanting to “know all the things,” keeping tabs on everything, incredibly “high context,” and thorough about understanding.</p><p name="e28b" id="e28b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Connecting</strong> in the sense of constantly “connecting the dots” to form the big picture, orchestrating the performance, keeping people in the loop, providing the glue or lubrication or the circulatory fluid or whatever metaphor you prefer for the combination of emotional intelligence, “soft skills,” and implicit ties that enable teams to thrive and work well.</p><p name="5da6" id="5da6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Courageous</strong> in the sense of being brave enough to take risks, make mistakes, face problems square on, evaluate failures coldly, and learn ferociously from every experience, good or bad.
