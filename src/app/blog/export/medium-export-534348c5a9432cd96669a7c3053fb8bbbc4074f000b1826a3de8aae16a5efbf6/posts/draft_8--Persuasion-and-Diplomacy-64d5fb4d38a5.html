Persuasion and Diplomacy</h3><p name="ea46" id="ea46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Product people work with large teams who generally do not report to them. How do they motivate and organize, inspire and lead teams who work in different ways for different bosses? It comes down to communication, empathy, and other so-called “soft skills” (or emotional intelligence).</em></p><p name="ac65" id="ac65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I joined 7 Cups as head of product the team was so small that for the first year or so I experienced something few product managers ever do: engineers who reported directly to me. This was a true product development team that ran the gamut from problem space discovery to shipping code. It was also, to being with, just three of us. I deliberately avoided using my VP title because I was also the only product manager, the only user researcher, the only UX designer, and the only data analyst. By the time we had built a mature engineering team with seven or eight developers it was past time for Eng to stand on its own and go toe-to-toe with me. The rare period of product and engineering unity couldn’t last, but it was glorious while it did.</p><p name="9e65" id="9e65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most product managers depend on engineers who do not report to them to write the code necessary to meet the requirements in their specs. They don’t accomplish this by bossing people around or answering their questions with “because I say so.” If the process is to succeed it is inherently collaborative, involve give-and-take and more often than not requires the product person to go the extra mile to understand the temperament, preferences, favorite issues, and fears of the engineers they work with.</p><blockquote name="bc26" id="bc26" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The more collaborative the relationship between product and engineering, the more likely it is that the developers become product people themselves over time.</blockquote><h3 name="caf7" id="caf7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote">Multidisciplinary teams</h3><p name="6cfb" id="6cfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Building great products requires orchestration. Teams bring together varying skill sets, experiences, points of view, incentives, and cultures. There’s a truism in tech that the ultimate experience customers have in your product ends up being a reflection of the team the build it. If the team is fragmented, the user experience will be too. If the team if in conflict, the product will show it. If the team learns to work together, respect each other’s points of view, and find common purpose, the product will sing.</p><p name="d247" id="d247" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This sort of orchestration doesn’t just happen. It requires a steady cadence of communication and constant readjustment to keep everyone in alignment, troubleshooting problems, and a sixth sense for when things are not really going as smoothly as they appear on the surface.</p><p name="2689" id="2689" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It also means overcommunication, especially in environments that involve remote work, which at the time I am writing this include basically all software development and which will likely to be the case for a large portion of the technology world for the foreseeable future.</p><h3 name="d3be" id="d3be" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What is overcommunication?</h3><p name="0566" id="0566" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What do I mean by overcommunication? Isn’t overdoing anything bad? Like oversharing? The point is that without consciously erring on the side of opting to communicate as frequently as possible and in every way possible, long-established habits will lead you to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">under</em>communicate when it matters most. You need to commit, as an organization to thorough communication in multiple modes and across many mutually reinforcing channels. </p><p name="d118" id="d118" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It also means not being passive. Not assuming word will get around. Not forgetting to keep people up to date. Not allowing cliques and claques and cabals to form. It means both a greater commitment to formal communications including quarterly roadmap updates, release notes, sprint retrospectives, newsletter-like team updates, “how to work with us” guidance in a wiki or other documentation, monthly product all-hands, participatory exercises for discovery of problem spaces, generating potential solutions, and aligning around priorities.</p><p name="04fc" id="04fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Much of this needs to be done formally include everyone. I’m reminded of an anecdote a friend told me about a meeting at her company in a conference room where some of the attendees connected remotely via video. As the meeting broke up, she and a colleague walked back to their cubicles and started a side conversation that was a continuation of one of the topics discussed in the meeting. </p><p name="e291" id="e291" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Her co-worker suggested they “hold that thought” and continue the conversation via Slack or Hipchat or whatever enterprise chat software their team used at the time, to explicitly <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">include</em> the remote members of the team and avoid inadvertently and unintentionally excluding them from an important discussion.</p><h3 name="b75f" id="b75f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Empathy</h3><p name="959e" id="959e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It also involves understanding motivations of teams or individuals who are blocking each other. Unless your enterprise is dysfunctional, it’s best to assume that everyone is doing their best to work together in good faith. When projects founder in the face of misalignment, pushback, or naysaying, product people need to take the time to deeply understand what is driving the conflict. </p><figure name="6de0" id="6de0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ECrlViTB6P7D7pSbOgnEBg.png" data-width="5100" data-height="3300" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ECrlViTB6P7D7pSbOgnEBg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Empathy is an innate human trait that some people have more of a temperamental capacity for without prompting but empathy can also be developed and tools such as an Empathy Map such as this version produced by Dave Gray for his Gamestorming book represents a good example of a process for systematically putting yourself in someone else’s shoes to understand what is driving them.</figcaption></figure><p name="4b90" id="4b90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A good question I ask when someone appears to be resisting without articulating why is “What are they afraid of?” I don’t mean this in a condescending or superior sense. I literally mean what is it that is frightening them? Are they worried the desirable solution is going to interfere with some aspect of their existing work that they particularly value? Does this ideas closely resemble (to them) one that went awry in the past? Do they perhaps have good product instincts themselves, instincts that are telling them something about the idea of the moment won’t work? </p><p name="eaf2" id="eaf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If so, it is worth it to take the time to get to the bottom of these concerns. Take them seriously. Face them head on. Respect the point of view even if it isn’t widely shared, and find a way forward that acknowledges and meets the challenges driving the fear or concern.</p><h3 name="fcb3" id="fcb3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Putting things in writing</h3><p name="e0a9" id="e0a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">So product people need to be good communicators, for all the many reasons touched throughout this book so far. Much of that communication takes place in the form of writing. For individual contributor product managers this likely involves requirements documents, specifications, reports, proposals, analyses, slack and email messages, comments on tickets. Product people in other roles may not generate this same <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">volume</em> of written content, but the need to be crisp, unambiguous, and clear remains. Product engineers need to write clear comments in their code and on their commits and pull requests. They also need to respond to comments on tickets and discuss nuanced technical issues in text chats.</p><p name="f2e7" id="f2e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Product designers need to annotate their mockups, make presentations with written components, and learn to defend and articulate the values of their designs in words.</p><p name="36ee" id="36ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not that these folks need to become prose stylists or start writing poetry in their spare time, but it’s important to recognize that using the “technology” of writing is a key craft skill at all levels for product professionals.</p><h3 name="1e6a" id="1e6a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">An ability to manage up</h3><p name="a69a" id="a69a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you’re a CEO this may be somewhat hard to hear but there are times when people on your team need to manage you. By this I don’t mean that they will try to manipulate you or that you don’t know your own business. It’s just that anyone executing for you is going to try to focus your attention where it can do the most good.</p><p name="b0e4" id="b0e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Product leadership at the highest level involves deep, close collaboration with the CEO. (In fact, as I’ll get into in the next chapter, in the early stage of a product organization, most likely the CEO themselves is the one providing product leadership.) This can mean sometimes making strong arguments against the gut instincts of the boss, and it often requires laying out the pros and cons, the benefits and the opportunity costs of competing options that each on their own face feel extremely desirable but which cannot all happen, definitely not all at once.</p><p name="4242" id="4242" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A good product leader should be able to help you understand difficult and disappointing truths without feeling misled or betrayed.</p><p name="bcec" id="bcec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This skill comes in handy all the way up and down the line. It draws on the exact same hard and soft skills, communication and otherwise, that help build horizontal alignment across product efforts. This is the vertical form of that same coherency-building skillset.</p><p name="2f58" id="2f58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember sitting in on an excellent class Luke Wroblewski taught when he was a senior designer at Yahoo (he is now a senior product executive at Google) about influence. Some of it dealt with how design skills can be used to communicate, defend ideas, and make data and arguments visible. But the thing that really stuck in my mind was the notion that you can only influence the people who you work with directly and at most one or two hops away from that.</p><p name="9039" id="9039" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is true in all of these directions. Horizontally you can have great influence on the people you work with daily and some influence on those they work with and people you encounter less frequently. Similarly, when you have direct reports you obviously influence them and likewise your relationship with your boss (if you have one, or your board or investors if you don’t) doesn’t extend much past a skip-level. The key insight he offered was that this is true for everyone. Even a CEO has trouble influencing people multiple steps below them in an HR ladder.</p><p name="7306" id="7306" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because of this the communication, consensus building, and frank problem solving skills of a product person come in handy at every level, both in binding collaborators together on projects as well as communication expectations and reporting progress and setbacks up the chain.</p><h3 name="2ca0" id="2ca0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Key takeways</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="7f2d" id="7f2d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3">Product people are responsible for the success of teams without the authority to boss those teams around.</li><li name="9da2" id="9da2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">This requires collaboration and orchestration skills that accommodate a wide variety of perspectives, skills, experiences, and even jargon.</li><li name="cae4" id="cae4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Product people dedicate a large portion of their energy to communication and <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">overcommunication.</em></li><li name="f2ae" id="f2ae" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">They also need to develop their <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">empathy</em> in order to effectively finesse the forces that pull different team members in multiple directions.</li><li name="95af" id="95af" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Product people are good at writing.
