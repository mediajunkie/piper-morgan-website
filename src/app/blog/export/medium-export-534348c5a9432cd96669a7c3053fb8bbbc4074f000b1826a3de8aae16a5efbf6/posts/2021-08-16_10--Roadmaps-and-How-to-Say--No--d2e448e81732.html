For the product manager’s peers and ordinary stakeholders, the roadmap can represent an opaque and even arbitrary lockbox that prevents them from getting the feature or design they want into the product.</p><blockquote name="3aa0" id="3aa0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Towards the end of this year Rosenfeld Media will be publishing my book <a href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/product-management-for-ux-designers/" data-href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/product-management-for-ux-designers/" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Product Management for UX People: From Designing to Thriving in a Product World</em></a> (you may sign up there to be notified when it is available for order), the culmination of a multiple-year project that has unfolded with the input and support of the <a href="https://designinproduct.typeform.com/to/H4PqHsVE" data-href="https://designinproduct.typeform.com/to/H4PqHsVE" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Design in Product</em> community</a>.</blockquote><blockquote name="b646" id="b646" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">During the editorial and production process I am sharing early drafts of chapters, and I welcome any feedback here that will strengthen the material.</blockquote><p name="10ed" id="10ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">For the product manager’s upper management, the roadmap often represents a commitment to deliberate specific features on specific dates and a source of angst, disappointment, and constantly reset expectation.</p><p name="3b08" id="3b08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some of the more common thing you’ll hear about a product roadmap from people in a tech company (including the product managers) are variations of</p><ul class="postList"><li name="77e1" id="77e1" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Where is the roadmap?”</li><li name="7255" id="7255" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li">“Is the roadmap up to date?” and</li><li name="61c3" id="61c3" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li">“Where are we on the roadmap?”</li></ul><p name="318b" id="318b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">So, a roadmap is obviously a metaphor but for what? What does it actually mean? What’s the car, what’s the road, what’s the destination, and what are the rest stops? Maybe let’s park the car on the shoulder and look this thing over calmly to figure out what exactly a roadmap is trying to tell us.</p><h3 name="8e1b" id="8e1b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Defining the Roadmap</h3><p name="9b1c" id="9b1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The songwriter Mose Allison once wrote “Everybody’s crying mercy, but they don’t know the meaning of the word.” So too, will you hear everyone talking about roadmaps but very few people agreeing on exactly what a roadmap is and what it’s supposed to do.</p><h4 name="ce95" id="ce95" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What is a roadmap?</h4><p name="f34d" id="f34d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As the metaphor implies, a roadmap is a plan for the “road” ahead, a map of where you hope to take your product, feature, or line of products. In some ways it’s more like the old “TripTik” that AAA still puts together for you to customize your road trip with just the stretches of highway and surface roads you’ll need to cover to get to your destination.</p><p name="497a" id="497a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what is the destination, in this metaphor? It turns out that is often the source of confusion. Inside a product team, a roadmap helps identify (and build consensus around) what to build now, what to plan for now to build next, and what to plan for next. It provides a way of tracking whether efforts are focused on the most important goals and if adequate progress is being made along the way.</p><p name="b4f9" id="b4f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Outside of product teams, most people view a roadmap as a commitment to ship specific features on certain dates in the months and years ahead, but this is a dangerous misconception that causes endless grief for product teams and equally frustrating disappointment for outside stakeholders.</p><h4 name="ca2a" id="ca2a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">A roadmap is not a launch plan</h4><p name="273d" id="273d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The biggest problem communicating about roadmaps is inevitably stakeholders interpreting it as a launch plan. If the roadmap suggests that you’ll be adding the new “Post to Tiktok” feature to your cooking app in Q2 and July rolls around without the feature shipping, it’s understandable that people are going to interpret that as a failure and a broken promise.</p><p name="1040" id="1040" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They may have built launch plans and a marketing campaign around this feature. They will be less likely to trust your predictions and commitments in the future, and they may invest less in supporting your feature launches in the future to minimize risk from a “once burned, twice shy” perspective.</p><p name="c07b" id="c07b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By the way, the solution to this problem is to make actual release and launch plans in collaboration with your sales and marketing teams, and include in it only things you actually can commit to shipping and only when you can commit to real dates. When people treat the product roadmap like a launch plan or complain that it doesn’t look like a gantt chart (see Figure 10.1), give them what they want but just keep clarifying that the project plan to ship a specific feature or set of releases on a schedule is a different artifact from the roadmap.</p><figure name="7ae4" id="7ae4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*mUr1Y1KCIr5ZIOcr.png" data-width="1327" data-height="617" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*mUr1Y1KCIr5ZIOcr.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Figure 10.1: If your stakeholders need a release plan, give them one, as shown in this Smartsheet template, but at the same time clarify that <em class="markup--em markup--figure-em">this is not a product roadmap.</em></figcaption></figure><h4 name="9443" id="9443" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Feasible horizons: Now, Next, Later</h4><p name="c128" id="c128" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A launch plan is anchored to fixed dates with dependencies running backwards along a critical path. Wearing a project management hat you can drive a team toward a launch, trim where needed to keep on track, detect and resolve problems in time, or negotiate new dates with sufficient advance warning when reality intervenes versus your best-laid plans.</p><p name="63ab" id="63ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A roadmap, by contrast, is a forward-looking document used to prioritize (primarily) near and medium term efforts. It is best structured into three rough time frames that can be viewed as a receding horizon getting less sharp as it gets further away: Now, Next, and Later (see Figure 10.2).</p><figure name="041d" id="041d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*NISTXpMTuy1aPzSLKUi2aQ.png" data-width="1812" data-height="1086" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NISTXpMTuy1aPzSLKUi2aQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Figure 10.2: This empty product roadmap template (using ProdPad) has three main columns, one for each timeframe.</figcaption></figure><h4 name="eb9b" id="eb9b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Now</h4><p name="dbab" id="dbab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Ideas in the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Now</em> bucket are (as you might have guessed already) things that your team is actively working on currently. This tends to mean things your developers are working on, code your are writing, things you are trying to ship (as opposed to ideas you are still just “noodling” with).</p><h4 name="0586" id="0586" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Next</h4><p name="cd17" id="cd17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Items in the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Next</em> bucket are on deck, as we say in baseball. They are the things we <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hope to</em> work on next, once the things were are working on now are done. Ah ha, you say! No ideas is ever done! True, but the ideas in these buckets are expressed in achievable chunks and a specific product or feature may be the subject of an ongoing series of ideas.</p><p name="9b81" id="9b81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Developers are usually not actively working on (or preparing to work on) the items in the Next bucket except occasionally to provide some technical ballast to planning and ideation sessions, but product managers, UX designers, and stakeholders generally <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">are</em> working on these ideas or their precursors, so that by the time there is room in the Now bucket they are ready to work on directly.</p><h4 name="5ec0" id="5ec0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Later</h4><p name="3641" id="3641" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Things in the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Later</em> bucket are important ideas that the team is building toward, but they are too speculative at this time, or too dependent on executing not just the Now items but some of the Next items as well, and so it’s not really worth anyone’s time to research, design, or architect these items, beyond capturing the idea as accurately as we can at this time, for when there is room in the Next bucket to really start digging in.</p><h3 name="1782" id="1782" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Product strategy</h3><p name="6a1f" id="6a1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">OK, none of this sounds like rocket science so far,</em> you may be thinking, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">but what goes into each column?</em> Or maybe you’re not asking yourself because you think you already know and the answer is “features” but that’s not it.</p><p name="0d8b" id="0d8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A product roadmap is not a list of features.</p><p name="e8b3" id="e8b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Features (or bug fixes, or experiments, or any other changes you ship to your codebase) are (tentative) solutions. They are the results of your research and design and development work and what you learn after releasing a feature feeds back into your research in the endless build, measure, learn cycle.</p><p name="4449" id="4449" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So it’s a mistake to jump right to features and start dropping them onto a plan. Not only does it lock you into specific solutions before you’ve done the work, it also sets concrete expectations with stakeholders leading them back down the path of hearing your roadmap as a release plan.</p><p name="eb56" id="eb56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what do you put in the roadmap? Outcomes, organized into themes, laddering up to company objectives.</p><h4 name="8a99" id="8a99" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Outcomes</h4><p name="db50" id="db50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">You don’t put features in your roadmap, you put outcomes. Results. Things you want to happen, such as:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="5496" id="5496" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Double retention</li><li name="a8df" id="a8df" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Increase customer satisfaction by 50%</li><li name="ab43" id="ab43" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Support user requests for more ways to collaborate with each other</li><li name="9b03" id="9b03" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Improve performance</li><li name="4b87" id="4b87" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Reengage with formerly active users</li></ul><p name="3254" id="3254" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">There might be any number of strategies for achieving the outcomes listed (made up) above, and any strategy might suggest a number of tactics worth trying. One of these tactics might be a feature that you might design, build, and ship, but there’s no need to lock yourself into a specific narrow <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">potential</em> solution now. It’s better to describe what the successful outcome you want looks like and then the work of the team is to figure out how to get there.</p><h4 name="e4be" id="e4be" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Organized into themes</h4><p name="dc74" id="dc74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To avoid having to sift through a completely random bucket of outcomes, and as a way of recognizing that goals and initiatives often require an ongoing series of efforts that will span multiple quarters, defining a set of themes to organize and associate outcomes helps keep things aligned, balanced, and legible.</p><p name="74b4" id="74b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It may be tempting to structure roadmap items in terms of the specific product area or functionality they relate to, but “signup,” “sharing,” and “profile management” aren’t themes. They are segments of your product. There’s nothing wrong with tracking this metadata and even indexing or sorting on it, but it’s not the right way to organize your roadmap by default.</p><p name="5b14" id="5b14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Themes tend to cluster around related <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">goals — </em>such as user growth, retention, revenue targets, network effects, behavioral patterns, and other — defined in your product strategy with the aim of fulfilling your business strategy (or, if you are in a non-business sector, your organization’s overarching strategy).</p><h4 name="8fb3" id="8fb3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Laddering up to company objectives</h4><p name="095c" id="095c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This nesting of strategy is key to product alignment. The organization has goals: long term goals, goals for this year, goals for this quarter or half. The product team within the organization therefore owns some of the responsibility for helping the org achieve those goals.</p><p name="2173" id="2173" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re in a product-centered org, then the product team may be driving most of the overall strategy!</p><p name="fb8b" id="fb8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the leadership level, the head of product coordinates with the rest of the executive team to negotiate commitments the product team can make to the org as a whole in order to fulfill larger objectives. Many tech companies use OKRs (objective and key results) as a framing device for:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="1e15" id="1e15" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">articulating clear objectives (basically the same as goals or outcomes) <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">and</em></li><li name="ec7c" id="ec7c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">identifying key results that are measurable and can either confirm or falsify whether the goal was achieved, or in the case of goals that can be achieved in whole or in part, measure to what extent the goal was achieved</li><li name="57d1" id="57d1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">aligning OKRs up and down an organization so that the objectives of any given team fulfill the key results of the team or leader they report to, all the way up (and down) the chain</li></ul><h4 name="77f3" id="77f3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Owning the roadmap, or part of it</h4><p name="64af" id="64af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If you are the head of product (congratulations!) then you probably own the whole roadmap. If you’re anyone else in the product org, then you probably own just a piece of it. (If you’re junior enough, you may nor actually own any of it, but you will at least be included in discussions about plans for the part of the product you are currently working on).</p><p name="a8b5" id="a8b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, a large product organization might have:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="8d3f" id="8d3f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">A product <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">portfolio</em> consisting of several lines of products, owned by a Chief Product Officer</li><li name="d7b6" id="d7b6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A line of products, owned by a VP of Product</li><li name="06c1" id="06c1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A specific product in a line of products owned by a Product Director</li><li name="d083" id="d083" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A major piece of functionality (onboarding, administration, core experience, etc.) owned by a Group Product Manager</li><li name="e85d" id="e85d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A feature owned by a Product Manager</li><li name="bffd" id="bffd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A backlog owned by a Product Owner</li></ul><p name="fded" id="fded" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">More often than not, outside of enterprise tech companies, you will not have so many levels of articulation and ownership, but the conceptual gradations exist at any scale.</p><p name="2d56" id="2d56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In such larger organizations, the demand for product operations (or “product ops”) starts to grow to manage the orchestration of multiple lines of business all trying to make use of the same product and development resources, and this alone can become a complex part of the roadmap planning process.</p><p name="d1a5" id="d1a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So let’s say that you do own at least some piece of the roadmap; that you are thinking in time horizons of now, next, and later; you’re aligned with your team on the major themes in your product strategy, and you’ve got a nice big backlog of great ideas for how to achieve important outcomes across all those themes.</p><p name="581c" id="581c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do you determine which idea goes in which bucket? This is a matter of prioritization, something that you are responsible for driving and achieving alignment on across all stakeholder even if you are not empowered to simply make all the tough calls yourself directly.</p><p name="03e2" id="03e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Converting the wishes and ideas of an org into a clear, usable roadmap is a fundamental responsibility of the product team and it doesn’t ever come easy.</p><h3 name="8408" id="8408" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Prioritization</h3><p name="0658" id="0658" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Products are more than just a bundle of features and bug fixes, and roadmaps are more than just a giant wishlist.</p><p name="b564" id="b564" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The product practice sits at the nexus of every input into, and every stakeholder of, the customer experience that represents your company’s brand. Product people shoulder the difficult but critical responsibility of weighing the opportunities (and risks) and forging a consensus that moves the team forward and helps deliver valuable outcomes.</p><p name="8b3d" id="8b3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There will always be a surplus of great ideas, new problems, ongoing unaddressed issues, deep-pocketed partners, eager sales efforts, business fads, and competitive setbacks.</p><p name="f89c" id="f89c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There will always be too many good ideas to do them all at once, without even getting into the opportunity costs involved in each or the fact that many good ideas are mutually incompatible.</p><p name="e4fb" id="e4fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, you can’t have two top priorities. You can have any number of important things that you think matter but only one of them can be the top priority (and if not, then you have zero top priorities, not two).</p><p name="d2b6" id="d2b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Weighing these priorities, wishes, good ideas, problems, etc. against each other is a fundamental product practice that takes place at every level of the business. Whoever speaks for product in the C-suite will ultimately decide what the entire product org or effort focuses on, what gets funded, who gets hired, headcount, and so on.</p><p name="9e64" id="9e64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Product leadership needs to address and respond to the business strategy through a product roadmap and operational plan. Product practitioners need to make hard choices about what to ship, what to work on next, the order of the backlog, the priority of bugs, and so on.</p><h4 name="4394" id="4394" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Prioritization methods</h4><p name="f18b" id="f18b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">It’s important to tackle prioritization in a systematic way. There is no one single ideal prioritization method or process or exercise that will suit every occasion and context, but there are always too many good ideas to go around, that stakeholders with varying degree of insight and claim over outcomes all need to be understood, respected, and addressed, and that a transparent open process for weighing and evaluating priorities works best.</p><p name="173b" id="173b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most common prioritization methods involve weighing the effort to execute an idea against the potential impact of doing so. In its simplest form, all ideas can be rated as high or low effort and then high or low impact. This enables a first-order rough sort. High impact, low effort things go first! Low impact, high effort things happen never. The other two categories then require more careful orchestration to balance the longer-term and larger efforts that may yield profoundly good results against the drumbeat of relatively trivial or tactical tasks that are easy to do but won’t in and of themselves “move the needle.”</p><h4 name="766d" id="766d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Impact vs Effort</h4><p name="57cb" id="57cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The next level of sophistication for that process is to use t-shirt sizes for estimates (small, medium, and large or S, M, L) which gives you another point on each scale. Most commonly a large surface such as a wall is cleared to enable an X and Y axis with Y (vertical) for impact and X (horizontal) for effort. The same logic applies at all of these scales: the stuff in furthest in the high impact/low effort corner comes first, and it’s the diagonal in the middle that requires the most scrutiny.</p><p name="6ea7" id="6ea7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For more complex decisions, frameworks such as RICE (reach, impact, confidence, and effort). This model keeps the concept of effort and impact from the simple one above but also give you a variable to scope the reach of the idea (is it going to impact all of your customers all the time? new users? a subset of existing users? etc.) as well a variable to capture how confident the estimate (or the consensus of the group) is, relative to other ideas.</p><p name="605e" id="605e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This latter factor helps address the subjectivity of a quasi-algebraic scoring model such as RICE, but ironically does so by introducing an additional subjective variable.</p><h4 name="6a03" id="6a03" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Important vs Urgent</h4><p name="9dff" id="9dff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Impact vs. effort builds on the concept of the Eisenhower matrix, Eisenhower matrix is a two-by-two grid that divides tasks, projects, or goals first by whether they are urgent or not, and then by whether they are important or not. The great advantage of this analysis is that it prevents you for confusing urgency for importance (and vice versa).</p><p name="b19b" id="b19b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is far too easy for any of us at any level of an organization to become reactive to urgent interruptions, emergencies, crisis, deadlines, launch dates, publicity schedules, quarterly reports, and so on. It is not possible to avoid urgent priorities and of course most urgent things need to be addressed, but not everything that’s urgent is important, and not every urgent thing needs to be handled at the highest level.</p><p name="ef44" id="ef44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More critically, there are many <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">important</em> things that are not urgent in the sense that they are not due immediately and they are not blocking anything right now but being postponed, but the great risk is that these things never get addressed (or, more likely, only ever get addressed when they become urgent, generally by way of catching on fire).</p><p name="46ae" id="46ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This analysis reminds us to plan and schedule longer term and slower-burning matters so that they come to fruition when they are needed and we escape the “take a crisis number” method of planning that is more akin to a panic attack than a sustainable execution process.</p><p name="8588" id="8588" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Eisenhower matrix (Figure 10.3) reminds you to do those things that are urgent and important immediately, and decide when important things that are not urgent need to happen (schedule them).

It helps to be conversant with multiple approaches partly so that you have a toolkit that you can adapt to different types of prioritization scenarios (what should the squad work on next sprint? what should the team build next quarter? what are the product goals for the second half of the year?), and partly so that you can adapt to the prevailing methods when joining an existing team.</p><blockquote name="e257" id="e257" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">From the Trenches</strong></blockquote><blockquote name="0f45" id="0f45" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Matt LeMay says “I like to think of all of these as communication frameworks.

Instead, you need to revisit the roadmap (or your bit of it) on regular cadences:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="cc28" id="cc28" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">On a monthly basis (if not each sprint) review the current workload of your team against the roadmap and make sure that the top commitments are getting attention. If the team is getting pulled into things that are not in the plan, escalate this to the attention of your boss. This does not mean refusing to do unplanned work (which would hardly be “agile”) but making sure that the roadmap doesn’t drift away from reality and become useless. Instead, any gap between planned work and actual is new information to be fed back in to the discussion and used to reset expectations and make intentional choices about new tradeoffs.</li><li name="6b25" id="6b25" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Each quarter revisit the roadmap with all stakeholders, review what got done, what has moved from Next to Now, what has moved from Later to Next, and what new ideas need to be tracked for Later.</li></ul><h4 name="ebcf" id="ebcf" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Managing Expectations</h4><p name="4126" id="4126" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As hard as you try to communicate that a roadmap deal with a series of time horizons that necessarily get more vague and speculative the further out you go, and no matter how carefully you build and present your roadmap in ways that don’t give the impression your are sharing a gantt chart delineating a project plan culminating in a launch or series of releases, there is no way to avoid the expectation that your team is going to ship certain promised features or solutions or fixes by committed deadlines.</p><p name="9958" id="9958" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thematic roadmaps don’t get you out of obligations.</p><p name="c34c" id="c34c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They can help frame the conversation, though. When you present a roadmap covering timeframes called Now, Next, and Later, and a stakeholder points to an item in the Next bucket and asks you when you expect the team to get to that, what do you say?</p><p name="cff1" id="cff1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One thing you can do is map the horizons to approximate chunks of time. What has worked for me is this:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4fba" id="4fba" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Now is this quarter, a roughly 1–3 month period depending on where we are in the quarter.</li><li name="6390" id="6390" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Next is the six month period following the current quarter. The items in that bucket will likely come to fruition in that period but it’s impossible to be more specific. (So at this point the plan covers roughly 7–9 months).</li><li name="dc6b" id="dc6b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Later is the nine month period that takes us out to about a year and a half from the start of the current quarter. It’s pretty much impossible to make plans further out than 18 months, and the items you’ve parked in the second half of that timeframe are necessarily broad and subject to revision every time you reevaluate your roadmap.</li></ul><p name="e9f2" id="e9f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Beyond that, the best way to manage the expectations of the people looking to your roadmap as the best insight into what to expect from your team is to present roadmap updates and status reports to the larger organization on a regular basis, at least once a quarter and more frequently for the teams directly adjacent to your own.</p><h3 name="aa41" id="aa41" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Epilogue to the Break Even story</h3><p name="506d" id="506d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you want to know things went at our startup once we hit break even, well that story hasn’t finished although my part of it has come to an end.

The more complex your product portfolio, and the more strongly they are hoping for something like a gantt chart, the more likely you may find yourself pressured into adopting (or at least “evaluating”) another roadmap product, Aha (Figure 10.9).</p><figure name="1cb7" id="1cb7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*AHvNCwAauc_2X4kH5kRqyA.png" data-width="2296" data-height="1010" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AHvNCwAauc_2X4kH5kRqyA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Figure 10.9: If you have a complex roadmap and need to communicate it in multiple ways, a tool like Aha can help (but it may drag you back into the “release plan vs. roadmap” battle all over again).</figcaption></figure><p name="244b" id="244b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Aha is powerful and provides many more dimensions of complexity than ProdPad does. Their model of products, projects, epics, and so on may not map perfectly to your product taxonomy, but it is fairly malleable and can be adapted to fit many complex environments.</p><p name="7c16" id="7c16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It also offers the ability to maintain entirely separate views of your roadmap so that you can make something with strong presentation values for a marketing department slide deck or a sales presentation and at the same time have an internal version of the roadmap that “lets it all hang out,” included internal maintenance, technical debt, and other unglamorous priorities, and provides more working detail.</p><p name="3a9e" id="3a9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately, you need to be agnostic about tools and able to ply your trade with whatever kit prevails in your current shop. When you’re the boss or building your own product org, you can own the exciting task of selection which product operations tools will unleash the awesome potential of your team.</p><blockquote name="e314" id="e314" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">A Day in the Life of a SaaS PM</strong></blockquote><blockquote name="e005" id="e005" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Ian Johnson, Principal/director of product at Flow Commerce Inc.</blockquote><blockquote name="7b4e" id="7b4e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">What industry do you work in?</strong> E-commerce</blockquote><blockquote name="7d88" id="7d88" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">How mature (or how long established) is the organization you work for?</strong> 4 years, 70 people</blockquote><blockquote name="ed2d" id="ed2d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Share anything else that might help describe the environment in which you practice product management:</strong> SaaS products B2B</blockquote><blockquote name="034e" id="034e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">How do you start your workday?</strong> Checking emails and Slack channels</blockquote><blockquote name="02e8" id="02e8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">How do you spend most of the morning?</strong> Either reading up on key industry reports, customer data or potentially responding to ad hoc requests.</blockquote><blockquote name="4774" id="4774" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">How does the morning end?</strong> Daily stand-up</blockquote><blockquote name="ac28" id="ac28" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">When do you take a lunch break, and what do you have for lunch?
