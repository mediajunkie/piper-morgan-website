Instead, I discovered something better: much of what I thought needed building was already built.</p><p name="88be" id="88be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The spatial intelligence system for Slack? Operational since July, twenty files deep. The GitHub deprecation router? Not only complete but already managing the transition from legacy to modern patterns. The Notion integration? Full spatial intelligence running in production.</p><p name="ae81" id="ae81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not 75% incomplete and abandoned. 75% built but undocumented.</p><h3 name="bc0c" id="bc0c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">When inching forward reveals solid ground</h3><p name="e4c1" id="e4c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">GREAT-2A was supposed to be an investigation phase — survey the integration cleanup needed across four services, identify patterns, plan the work. Standard reconnaissance before systematic execution.</p><p name="009c" id="009c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I found instead was a functioning architecture I’d forgotten I’d built.</p><p name="8df9" id="8df9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The GitHub service had not just spatial intelligence wrappers but a sophisticated deprecation router managing the four-week transition from legacy patterns. Comments in the code showed careful thought about backward compatibility and migration paths. The Slack integration included webhook routers and response handlers I didn’t remember creating.</p><p name="f2f1" id="f2f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most surprising: twenty files of spatial intelligence infrastructure, including complete implementations for services I thought were still using raw API calls.</p><p name="7b98" id="7b98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The pattern wasn’t incomplete work left behind. It was complete work that had been invisibly supporting the system while I focused on the dramatic problems.</p><h3 name="441c" id="441c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The undramatic progress that accumulates</h3><p name="be90" id="be90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The research sideshow on Friday — exploring PRD best practices, Chrome DevTools integration, multi-agent coordination patterns — didn’t interfere with inchworm priorities because the inchworm approach creates space for exploration. When you’re confident in your systematic progress, you can afford to look around.</p><p name="d707" id="d707" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More importantly, Friday’s discoveries showed that steady, undramatic progress had been accumulating for months. Not just since the Great Refactor started, but through the earlier periods when I thought I was struggling to make meaningful headway.</p><p name="3e4a" id="3e4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The spatial intelligence system didn’t appear overnight. The deprecation routers weren’t built in a weekend sprint. The webhook infrastructure wasn’t the result of a breakthrough moment.</p><p name="59d8" id="59d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They were the product of consistent, incremental work that had been building substantial foundations while I was focused on the obvious blockers.</p><h3 name="5d3b" id="5d3b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The quiet reward of persistence</h3><p name="f8bb" id="f8bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">GREAT-2A’s smooth progress felt different from GREAT-1’s dramatic resurrection. No broken imports to fix, no regression hunting, no systematic debugging of months-old problems. Just methodical verification that revealed working systems where I expected to find gaps.</p><p name="e71f" id="e71f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The GitHub integration needed spatial migration? Already 75% complete with a deprecation router managing the transition.</p><p name="9d36" id="9d36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Slack service needed modern patterns? Already implemented with spatial intelligence operational.</p><p name="984e" id="984e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The documentation needed updating? True, but the code underneath was solid.</p><p name="6af8" id="6af8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is what persistence produces when you’re not watching. The daily incremental choices, the “while I’m here” improvements, the systematic approach applied consistently over time — they accumulate into substantial foundations even when individual days feel unproductive.</p><h3 name="3ef8" id="3ef8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Recognition without celebration</h3><p name="8506" id="8506" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The contrast with GREAT-1’s completion was telling. Thursday night brought the quiet satisfaction of defeating a months-old blocker through systematic work. Friday brought something subtler: recognition that the foundation was already more solid than I’d realized.</p><p name="8e10" id="8e10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No victory laps for discovering your own forgotten work. No celebration for finding operational systems you thought were incomplete. Just the steady confidence that comes from understanding you’ve been building more effectively than you knew.</p><p name="aff5" id="aff5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The inchworm doesn’t just move forward methodically — it reveals the solid ground that was already there.</p><h3 name="f24a" id="f24a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What this means for complex projects</h3><p name="bac5" id="bac5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Every long-running project has this hidden foundation layer. The incremental improvements that don’t feel significant in the moment but accumulate into substantial capability over time. The background systems that work so well you forget they exist.</p><p name="14c6" id="14c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The traditional approach is to assume everything needs rebuilding when progress feels slow. Start over with better architecture, cleaner patterns, more systematic approaches.</p><p name="cbc4" id="cbc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The inchworm approach says: investigate first. Often the problem isn’t missing foundations but insufficient recognition of existing ones. Document what’s already there before deciding what needs building.</p><p name="a40b" id="a40b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some patterns from Friday’s investigation:</p><p name="e63e" id="e63e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Survey before you build.</strong> GREAT-2A’s investigation phase prevented weeks of redundant work by revealing operational systems I thought were incomplete.</p><p name="7c28" id="7c28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trust incremental progress.</strong> Months of daily choices had created substantial infrastructure even when individual days felt unproductive.</p><p name="0036" id="0036" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Document working systems.</strong> The gap wasn’t missing capability but missing documentation of existing capability.</p><p name="1f61" id="1f61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Distinguish between architectural debt and implementation debt.</strong> The patterns were sound, the code was working — only the documentation lagged behind reality.</p><p name="446b" id="446b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Recognize accumulated progress.</strong> Steady work produces substantial foundations even when daily progress feels minimal.</p><p name="2587" id="2587" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The unsexy truth: consistent incremental work builds more than sporadic breakthrough efforts.</p><h3 name="cfed" id="cfed" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The expanding foundation</h3><p name="4441" id="4441" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">By Friday afternoon, GREAT-2’s scope had shifted dramatically. Not building spatial intelligence systems from scratch, but completing the documentation for operational systems. Not creating deprecation routers, but verifying the existing ones worked as designed.</p><p name="5d70" id="5d70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">GREAT-2B through 2E were still substantial work — completing migrations, fixing documentation links, updating ADR compliance. But the foundation was solid in ways I hadn’t recognized.</p><p name="dcf0" id="dcf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The research explorations became footnotes rather than urgent priorities. When you discover your foundations are stronger than expected, you can afford to explore enhancements rather than scrambling to build basics.</p><h3 name="91a6" id="91a6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Looking ahead with earned recognition</h3><p name="04b8" id="04b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The confidence from GREAT-1’s completion was about proving the methodology worked under pressure. The confidence from GREAT-2A’s discoveries was different: recognition that months of steady work had produced more than I’d tracked.</p><p name="2868" id="2868" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This isn’t about lowering standards or accepting partial work. The spatial intelligence systems were genuinely operational, the deprecation routers genuinely managing transitions, the webhook infrastructure genuinely handling production traffic.</p><p name="8692" id="8692" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s about recognizing that systematic progress accumulates even when you’re not measuring it. The daily incremental improvements, the “while I’m here” fixes, the consistent application of good patterns — they build substantial capability over time.</p><p name="c493" id="c493" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">GREAT-2 continues with documentation and verification rather than construction and debugging. The path to MVP looks increasingly realistic not because the scope decreased, but because the foundation was already larger than expected.</p><p name="747c" id="747c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The inchworm keeps inching forward, now with clearer understanding of the solid ground beneath each step.</p></div></div></section><section name="b3c0" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="e70d" id="e70d" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Next on Building Piper Morgan: Building the Cathedral: When AI Agents Need the Big Picture.</em></p><p name="1993" id="1993" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">How do you track the incremental progress that accumulates invisibly?
